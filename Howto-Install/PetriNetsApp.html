<h1>The Application of PetriNets to Workflow Management</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Petri nets can be used as a design language for the specification of complex workflows.
  <li>Petri net theory provides for powerful analysis techniques which can be used to verify the correctness of workflow procedures.
  <li>Consider VM operators (e.g., build, start, suspend, stop) to bo tasks of workflow.
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Motivation:
    There were no generic tools to support workflow management.
    <img src="img/Workflow-his.png">
  <li>The main purpose of a workflow management system:
    <ul>
      <li>definition
      <li>execution
      <li>registration
      <li>control of <b>processes</b>
    </ul>
<br>
  <li>Reasons for using Petri net for workflow modeling:
    <ul>
      <li>formal semantics
	<br>A workflow process specified in terms of a Petri net has a clear and precise definition, because the semantics of the classical Petri net and several enhancements (color, time, hierarchy) <b>have been defined formally</b>.<br><br>
      <li>graphical nature
	<br>Petri nets are a graphical language. As a result, Petri nets are <b>intuitive and easy to learn</b>. The graphical nature also supports the communication with end-users.<br><br>
      <li>expressiveness
	<br>Petri nets <b>support all the primitives needed to model a workflow process</b>. All the routing constructs present in today's workflow management systems can be modeled. Moreover, the fact that states are represented explicitly, allows for the modeling of milestones and implicit choices.<br><br>
      <li>propertires
	<br>In the last three decades <b>many people have investigated the basic properties of Petri nets</b>. The firm mathematical foundation allows for the reasoning about these properties. As a result, there is a lot of common knowledge, in the form of books and articles, about this modeling technique.<br><br>
      <li>analysis
	<br>Petri nets are marked by the availability of many analysis techniques. Clearly, this is a great asset in favor of the use of Petri nets for workflow modeling. <b>These techniques can be used to prove properties</b> (safety properties, invariance properties, deadlock, etc.) and <b>to calculate performance measures</b> (response times, waiting times, occupation rates, etc.). In this way it is possible to evaluate alternative workflows using standard Petri-net-based analysis tools.<br><br>
      <li>vendor independent
	<br>Petri nets provide <b>a tool-independent framework</b> for modeling and analyzing processes. Petri nets are not based on a software package of a specific vendor and do not cease to exist if a new version is released or when one vendor takes over another vendor.<br><br>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Workflow management (system)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The ultimate goal of workflow management is to make sure that the proper activities are executed by the right person at the right time.</li><br>
  <li>The Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) defines a workflow management system as follows ([WFM96]): <i>A system that completely defines, manages, and executes workflows through the execution of software whose order of execution is driven by a computer representation of the workflow logic.</i></li><br>
  <li>characterize a  Workflow Management system are:
    <ul>
      <li>business operating system
      <li>workflow manager
      <li>case manager
      <li>logistic control system
    </ul></li><br>
  <li>Workflows are case-based.</li><br>
  <li>Cases are handled by executing tasks <b>in a specific order</b>. </li><br>
  <li>Alternative terms for workflow process definition:
    <ul>
      <li>procedure
      <li>flow diagram
      <li>routing definition
    </ul></li><br>
  <li>Each task has pre- and postconditions:
    <ul>
      <li>the pre-conditions should hold before the task is executed.
      <li>the post-conditions should hold after execution of the task.
    </ul></li><br>
  <li>A task which needs to be executed for a specific case is called a <b>work item</b>. </li><br>
  <li>Most work items are executed by a <b>resource</b>.</li><br>
  <li>To facilitate the allocation of work items to resources, resources are grouped into <b>classes</b>. A <b>resource class</b> is a group of resources with similar characteristics.
</li><br>
  <li>If a resource class is based on the <b>capabilities</b> (i.e. functional requirements) of its members, it is called a <b>role</b>. </li><br>
  <li>If the classification is based on the <b>structure</b> of the organization, such a resource class is called an <b>organizational unit</b> (e.g. team, branch or department). </li><br>
  <li>A work item which is being executed by a specific resource is called an <b>activity</b>. </li><br>

  <li>Four type of routing
    <ol>
      <li>sequential<br>
	<img src="img/sequential.png">
      </li><br>
      <li>parallel<br>
	<ul>
	  <li>AND-split
	  <li>AND-join
	</ul>
	<img src="img/parallel.png"><br>
      </li><br>
      <li>conditional (exclusive OR)<br>
	<ul>
	  <li>OR-split
	  <li>OR-join
	</ul>

      <li>iteration<br>

    </ol>
</li><br>
  
  <li>A workflow process is characterized by three qualities.
  <ol>
    <li>a workflow process is casedriven.
    <li>the process itself is considered to be essential.
    <li>he process can be defined in an explicit manner.
  </ol></li><br>
	<img src="img/workflow-processes.png">
	<br><br>
  <li><b>Production workflow</b> is concerned which highly structured processes with almost no variations. </li>
  <li><b>Administrative workflow</b> corresponds to case-driven processes which follow a well-defined procedure. </li>
  <li><b>Ad-hoc workflow</b> relates to processes where the procedure is not defined (completely) in advance. </li>
  <li><b>Collaborative processes</b> are outside the scope of our definition of workflow. </li>
