<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/install/content/terminology-storage.html">(Source Origin)</a></h3>
<p>Many cloud computing use cases require persistent remote storage.  Storage 
solutions are often divided into three categories: object storage, block storage, and 
file storage.</p>
<p>Note that some storage solutions support multiple categories. For example, 
NexentaStor supports both block storage and file storage (with announcements for 
future support for object storage), GlusterFS supports file storage and object 
storage, and  Ceph Storage supports object storage, block storage, and file storage.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.wwpi.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14659:object-storage-where-cloud-computing-and-big-data-meet&catid=317:ctr-exclusives&Itemid=2701734" target="newwindow">Object storage</a></h4>
<p>In OpenStack: Object Storage service (Swift) 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related concepts: Amazon S3, Rackspace 
Cloud Files, Ceph Storage</p>
<p>With <span class="italic">object storage</span>, files are exposed through
  an HTTP interface, typically with a REST API. All client data access is done at 
  the user level: the operating system is unaware of the presence of the remote 
  storage system. In OpenStack, the Object Storage service provides this type of
  functionality. Users access and modify files by making HTTP requests. Because the
  data accesss interface provided by an object storage system is at a low level of
  abstraction, people often build on top of object storage to build file-based
  applications that provide a higher level of abstraction. For example, the OpenStack
  Image service can be configured to use the Object Storage service as a backend.
  Another use for object storage solutions is as a content delivery network (CDN) for
  hosting static web content (e.g., images, and media files), since object storage
  already provides an HTTP interface. </p>
<h4>Block storage (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network" 
target="newwindow">SAN</a>)</h4>
<p>In OpenStack: Volumes (<code class="systemitem">nova-volume</code> service) 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatd concepts: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), 
  Ceph RADOS Block Device (RBD), iSCSI</p>
<p>With <span class="italic">block storage</span>, files are exposed through a
  low-level computer bus interface such as SCSI or ATA, that is accessible over the
  network. Block storage is synonymous with SAN (storage area network). Clients access
  data through the operating system at the device level: users access the data by
  mounting the remote device in a similar manner to how they would mount a local,
  physical disk (e.g., using the "mount" command in Linux). In OpenStack, the
      <code class="systemitem">nova-volume</code> service that forms part of
  the Compute service provides this type of functionality, and uses iSCSI to expose
  remote data as a SCSI disk that is attached to the network. </p>
<p>Because the data is exposed as a physical device, the end-user is responsible for
  creating partitions and formatting the exposed disk device. In addition, in
  OpenStack Compute a device can only be attached to one server at a time, so block
  storage cannot be used for to share data across virtual machine instances
  concurrently. </p>
<h4>File storage (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage" 
target="newwindow">NAS</a>)</h4>
<p>In OpenStack: none 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related concepts: NFS, Samba/CIFS, GlusterFS, Dropbox, 
Google Drive</p>
<p>With <span class="italic">file storage</span>, files are exposed through a
  distributed file system protocol. Filesystem storage is synonymous with NAS (network
  attached storage). Clients access data through the operating system at the file
  system level: users access the data by mounting a remote file system. Examples of
  file storage include NFS and GlusterFS. The operating system needs to have the
  appropriate client software installed to be able to access the remote file system. </p>
<p>Currently, OpenStack Compute does not have any native support for this type of
  file storage inside of an instance. However, there is a 
<a  href="http://gluster.org/community/documentation//index.php/OSConnect"

  Posted on July 24, 2012 by Larry Peterson</div>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>I've recently posted several articles about the advantages of 
running network functions on virtualized commodity servers, and while 
it's important to make the general case for replacing purpose-built 
hardware appliances with commodity servers, there's a more focused story
 centered around CDNs that's worth telling.</p>
<p>It involves a slight change in perspective. Rather than view a CDN as
 one of many services that can be deployed on a virtualized platform-in 
an earlier <a title="article" 
href="http://www.verivue.com/blog/index.php/content-cloud-computing-strategies/network-virtualization/">article</a> 
I talked about a spectrum of services ranging from BRAS to CDN-think of the 
CDN <em>as the platform</em> on which an important subset of network functions 
are deployed... those related to content delivery. Virtual machines are an 
enabling technology, but the important point is that a CDN serves as the 
cornerstone for a rich collection of functions that enable network 
operators to sell web acceleration solutions to their business and 
enterprise customers.</p>
<p>In other words, it's fair to view a CDN as a platform that hosts 
functions to accelerate B2C and B2B transactions over the Internet, 
especially transactions that involve cloud-based services. In this 
scenario, the CDN runs at the edge of the operator's network, where in 
addition to caching static objects, it also hosts client-facing and 
cloud-facing optimizations. The client-facing optimizations, often 
collectively called <em>front-end optimization</em>, include an 
assortment of techniques aimed at reducing transaction response time, as
 well as SSL termination, TCP enhancements for mobile applications, and 
business logic offload. The cloud-facing optimizations, sometimes called
 <em>WAN acceleration</em>, include symmetric strategies for compression
 and de-duplication. (It is notable that these latter techniques are 
typically symmetric because the CDN provides a point-of-presence both in
 the data center and at the edge of the network.)</p>
<p>An architecture for CDN-as-a-Platform has two major elements. The 
first is edge service nodes that not only cache static objects, but also
 run a policy engine that governs how the CDN interacts with clients 
that make requests and public/private clouds that host business 
services. This policy engine receives and processes client HTTP 
requests, dispatches the request to the appropriate module for 
processing, and when communication with the data center is required 
(e.g., to satisfy cache misses or to access dynamic state), selects the 
appropriate module to optimize communication with those servers. In 
Verivue's case, some of these modules are part of the OneVantage product
 portfolio (some run their own VMs and others are cache plug-ins), while
 others are provided by third-party service venders (these are typically
 isolated in their own VMs).</p>
<p>The second element of the CDN-as-a-Platform architecture is the 
lynchpin - a&nbsp; unified approach to service management. The management 
suite is responsible for provisioning virtual machines, configuring the 
services deployed in those virtual machines, proactively monitoring the 
deployment, and collecting traffic logs for billing and analytics. The 
core of the management suite is a data model that presents operators 
with a comprehensive and coherent picture of the available network 
functions that they must manage.</p>
<p>A clear understanding of&nbsp; this data model is starting to emerge.
 It includes objects that model the central stake-holders, including CDN
 Operators, Service Providers, and Content Providers (i.e., business 
customers); objects that model the deployed infrastructure, including 
virtual/physical nodes and network interfaces; objects that model the 
set of services and modules instantiated on that infrastructure; and 
objects that model the set of policy directives that govern how those 
services and modules behave.</p>
<p>These rules and policies, in turn, include: (1) routing directives 
that govern how end-users are routed to the best service node to process
 a given request, (2) delivery directives that govern how the selected 
service node delivers the resources named in the request, (3) anchor 
directives that govern how the service node interacts with cloud-hosted 
business services that anchor the request, and (4) analytic directives 
that govern how the service node gathers and processes traffic 
statistics. In other words, these rules collectively control what 
service node is selected to serve a given end-user, what module(s) are 
invoked at that node to customize delivery for that particular user, how
 those modules are parameterized to serve a particular end-user, and how
 data is collected.</p>
<p>Coordinating these policy directives across a set of services and 
modules requires a unifying abstraction that defines the scope for each 
directive. We call the scope a <em>delivery domain</em>, and it 
corresponds to the subset of URIs to which a given set of rules and 
policies is to be applied. A delivery domain is represented (identified)
 in one of two ways. The first is a CDN-Prefix, which corresponds to the
 FQDN at the beginning of a URI; it effectively carves out a region of 
the URI name space to which a set of rules and policies are to be 
applied. The second is a URI-Filter, which is given by a regular 
expression; it effectively identifies a subset of URIs belonging to a 
CDN-Prefix that is to be treated in a uniform way.</p>
<p>In summary, a CDN-powered platform allows business and enterprise 
customers to accelerate their cloud-hosted web services by effectively 
extending the cloud from the data center out to the edge of the 
operator's network. Service nodes deployed at the network edge provide 
the optimal vantage point to co-locate caching, front-end optimization, 
and WAN acceleration technologies, where the management suite plays a 
central role in coordinating the resulting data center-to-edge cloud on 
behalf of B2C and B2B customers.</p>

<h4>Trends in Cloud Storage: CDN 
<a href="http://www.verivue.com/blog/index.php/content-cloud-computing-strategies/trends-in-cloud-storage/" target="newwindow">(Source Origin)</a></h4>
<div class="entry-meta">
Posted on August 20, 2012 by Larry Peterson</div>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Here's a modest insight. When designing a cloud storage system,
 there is value in decoupling the system's archival capacity (its 
ability to persistently store large volumes of data) from the system's 
delivery capacity (its ability to deliver popular objects to a scalable 
number of users). The archival half need not support scalable 
performance, and likewise, the delivery half need not guarantee 
persistence.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this translates into an end-to-end storage 
solution that includes a high-capacity and highly resilient object store
 in the data center, augmented with caches throughout the network to 
take advantage of aggregated delivery bandwidth from edge sites. This is
 similar to what Amazon offers today: S3 implements a resilient object 
store in the data center, augmented with CloudFront to scale delivery 
through a distributed set of edge caches.</p>
<p>The object store runs in the data center, ingests data from some 
upstream source (e.g., video prepared using a Content Management 
System), and delivers it to users via edge caches. The ingest interface 
is push-based and likely includes one or more popular APIs (e.g., FTP, 
WebDAV, S3), while the delivery interface is pull-based and corresponds 
to HTTP GET requests from the CDN.</p>
<p>In past articles I have written extensively about how to architect a 
CDN that can be deployed throughout an operator network, claiming that a
 well-designed CDN should be agnostic as to the source of content. But 
it is increasingly the case that content delivered over a CDN is sourced
 from a data center as part of a cloud-based storage solution. This begs
 the question: is there anything we can learn by looking at storage from
 such an end-to-end perspective?</p>
<p>I see three points worth making, although in way of a disclaimer, I'm
 starting from the perspective of the CDN, and looking back to what I'd 
like to see from a data center based object store. The way I see it, 
though, there's more value in storing data if you have a good approach 
to distributing it to users that want to access it.</p>
<p>First, it makes little sense to build an object store using 
traditional SAN or NAS technology. This is for two reasons. One has to 
do with providing the right level of abstraction. In this case, the CDN 
running at the network edge is perfectly capable of dealing with a large
 set of objects, meaning there is no value in managing those objects 
with full file system semantics (i.e., NAS is a bad fit). Similarly, the
 storage system needs to understand complete objects and not just blocks
 (i.e., SAN is not a good fit). The second reason is related to cost. It
 is simply more cost effective to build a scalable object store from 
commodity components. This argument is well understood, and leverages 
the ability to achieve scalable performance and resiliency in software.</p>
<p>Second, a general-purpose CDN that is able to deliver a wide range of
 content-from software updates to video, from large files to small 
objects, from live (linear) streams to on-demand video, from 
over-the-top to managed video-should not be handicapped by an object 
store that isn't equally flexible. In particular, it is important that 
the ingest function be low-latency and redundant, so it is possible to 
deliver both on-demand and live video. (Even live video needs to be 
staged through an object store to support time shifting.)</p>
<p>Third, it is not practical to achieve scalable delivery from a data 
center. Data centers typically provide massive internal bandwidth, 
making it possible to build scalable storage from commodity servers, but
 Internet-facing bandwidth is generally limited. This is just repeating 
the argument in favor of delivering content via a CDN-scalable delivery 
is best achieved from the edge.</p>

<a name="Ceph"></a><h3>Ceph: Open Source Storage</h3>
<EM><P> As the size and performance requirements of storage systems have increased, 
file system designers have looked to new architectures to facilitate system 
scalability.  Ceph's architecture consists of an object storage, block storage and 
a POSIX-compliant file system. It's in the most significant storage system that has 
been accepted into the Linux kernel. Ceph has both kernel and userland 
implementations.  The CRUSH algorithm controlled, scalable, decentralized placement 
of replicated data. In addition, it has a fully leveraged, highly scalable metadata 
layer. Ceph offers compatibility with S3, Swift and Google Storage and is a drop in 
replacement for HDFS (and other File Systems).
<P> Ceph is unique because it's massively scalable to the exabyte level. The storage 
system is self-managing and self-healing which means limited system administrator 
involvement. It runs on commodity hardware, has no single point of failure, 
leverages an intelligent storage node system and it open source.</em>
<p> <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/storage/systems/232901454" 
   target="newwindow">(Source Origin:)</a> A <a href="http://ceph.com">Ceph 
system</a> is built on industry-standard servers and consists of nodes which handle 
either file-based, block, or SAN-based or object-based storage. A Ceph cluster 
consists of a portable operating system interface 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a>)-compliant file system, 
storage nodes, a metadata server daemon (or computer program), and monitor daemons 
that track the state of the cluster and the nodes in the cluster.  Ceph uses an 
algorithm called CRUSH (controlled scalable decentralized placement of replicated 
data) to define where objects store data in the cluster and also track modified 
content for placement on the appropriate media.
<p>
Ceph can also be deployed as a block-based storage system. In this configuration, Ceph 
is mounted as a thin-provisioned block device. When data is written to Ceph, it is 
automatically striped and replicated across the cluster. The Ceph RADOS Block Device 
(RDB) works with KVM and supports the import and export of virtual machine images and 
provides snapshot capability.
</p>
<p>
The system can also serve as a file system where it maps the directories and file names 
of the file system to objects stored in RADOS clusters. The size of these clusters can 
be expanded or contracted and the workload is automatically rebalanced. 
<p>
Like file system clusters such as Gluster and Lustre, Ceph is scalable to multiple 
exabytes of data. Ceph is included in the Linux kernel and integrated into the 
OpenStack project. 
<p>
Because, like other open source projects, Ceph can be difficult to install, configure, 
and maintain, Inktank became the official sponsor of Ceph and will provide not only 
installation and configuration, performance testing, and infrastructure assessment 
services, but support for Ceph itself. The company has developed a community for Ceph 
users where they can chat about Ceph implementation and other issues.
<p>
Ceph was designed by Sage Weil, CEO and founder of Inktank, as part of a PhD thesis at 
the University of California at Santa Cruz. Weil released Ceph into the open source 
community in 1997. Weil is also a co-founder of DreamHost, the hosting company that 
developed Ceph and spun it off to Inktank.
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph#Etymology">Ceph is named after</a> the UC 
Santa Cruz mascot, Sammy, a banana slug mollusk. Ceph is short for cephalopods, a class 
of mollusks. Since nearly all mollusks release ink, it's likely that Inktank's name 
also derives from UC Santa Cruz's mascot.

<p></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp; Linux continues to invade the scalable computing 
 space and, in particular, the scalable storage space. A recent addition to Linux's
 impressive selection of file systems is Ceph, a distributed file system that
 incorporates replication and fault tolerance while maintaining POSIX
 compatibility. Explore the architecture of Ceph and learn how it provides
 fault tolerance and simplifies the management of massive amounts of
 data.</p>
<h4>Intro.</h4>
 <p>As an architect in the storage industry, I have an affinity to file
     systems. These systems are the user interfaces to storage systems, and
     although they all tend to offer a similar set of features, they also can
     provide notably different features. Ceph is no different, and it offers
     some of the most interesting features you'll find in a file system. </p>
 <p>Ceph began as a PhD research project in storage systems by Sage Weil at the
     University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). But as of late March 2010,
     you can now find Ceph in the mainline Linux kernel (since 2.6.34).
     Although Ceph may not be ready for production environments, it's still
     useful for evaluation purposes. This article explores the Ceph file system
     and the unique features that make it an attractive alternative for
     scalable distributed storage. </p>
<h4>Why "Ceph"?</h4>
     
<p>"Ceph" is an odd name for a file system and breaks the typical acronym trend that 
   most follow.  The name is a reference to the mascot at UCSC (Ceph's origin), which 
   happens to be "Sammy," the banana slug, a shell-less mollusk in the cephalopods 
   class. Cephalopods, with their multiple tentacles, provide a great metaphor for a 
   distributed file system. </p>
<h4><a name="goals"><span class="atitle">Ceph goals</span></a></h4>
 
<a name="name"></a>            
 <p>Developing a distributed file system is a complex endeavor, but it's immensely 
    valuable if the right problems are solved. Ceph's goals can be simply defined 
    as: </p>
 <ul>
     <li>Easy scalability to multi-petabyte capacity</li>
     <li>High performance over varying workloads (input/output operations per
    second [IOPS] and bandwidth) </li>
     <li>Strong reliability</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Unfortunately, these goals can compete with one another (for example,
     scalability can reduce or inhibit performance or impact reliability). Ceph
     has developed some very interesting concepts (such as dynamic metadata
     partitioning and data distribution and replication), which this article
     explores shortly. Ceph's design also incorporates fault-tolerance features
     to protect against single points of failure, with the assumption that
     storage failures on a large scale (petabytes of storage) will be the norm
     rather than the exception. Finally, its design does not assume particular
     workloads but includes the ability to adapt to changing distributed
     workloads to provide the best performance. It does all of this with the
     goal of POSIX compatibility, allowing it to be transparently deployed for
     existing applications that rely on POSIX semantics (through Ceph-proposed
     enhancements). Finally, Ceph is open source distributed storage and part
     of the mainline Linux kernel (2.6.34). </p>          
<h4><a name="architecture"><span class="atitle">Ceph architecture</span></a></h4>
 <p>Now, let's explore the Ceph architecture and its core elements at a high
     level. I then dig down another level to identify some of the key aspects
     of Ceph to provide a more detailed exploration. </p>
 <p>The Ceph ecosystem can be broadly divided into four segments (see Figure
     1): clients (users of the data), metadata servers (which cache and
     synchronize the distributed metadata), an object storage cluster (which
     stores both data and metadata as objects and implements other key
     responsibilities), and finally the cluster monitors (which implement the
     monitoring functions). </p>
 
 <br><a name="fig1"><b>Figure 1. Conceptual architecture of the Ceph ecosystem</b>
     </a><br>
  <img alt="Conceptual flowchart showing the architecture of the Ceph ecosystem: 
   clients, metadata server cluster, object storage cluster, and cluster monitors" 
   src="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-ceph/figure1.gif" 
   height="317" width="381">
 <br>
 <p>As Figure 1 shows, clients perform metadata operations (to identify the
     location of data) using the metadata servers. The metadata servers manage
     the location of data and also where to store new data. Note that metadata
     is stored in the storage cluster (as indicated by "Metadata I/O"). Actual
     file I/O occurs between the client and object storage cluster. In this
     way, higher-level POSIX functions (such as open, close, and rename) are
     managed through the metadata servers, whereas POSIX functions (such as read
     and write) are managed directly through the object storage cluster. </p>
 <p>Another perspective of the architecture is provided in Figure 2. A set of 
    servers access the Ceph ecosystem through a client
     interface, which understands the relationship between metadata servers and
     object-level storage. The distributed storage system can be viewed in a
     few layers, including a format for the storage devices (the Extent and
     B-tree-based Object File System [EBOFS] or an alternative) and an
     overriding management layer designed to manage data replication, failure
     detection, and recovery and subsequent data migration called <em>Reliable
    Autonomic Distributed Object Storage</em> (RADOS). Finally, monitors
     are used to identify component failures, including subsequent
     notification. </p>
 
     <br><a name="fig2"><b>Figure 2. Simplified layered view of
    the Ceph ecosystem </b></a><br>

      height="270" width="465">
 <br>
<h4><a name="components"><span class="atitle">Ceph components</span></a></h4>
 <p>With the conceptual architecture of Ceph under your belts, you can dig down
     another level to see the major components implemented within the Ceph
     ecosystem. One of the key differences between Ceph and traditional file
     systems is that rather than focusing the intelligence in the file system
     itself, the intelligence is distributed around the ecosystem.</p>
 
 <p>Figure 3
     shows a simple Ceph ecosystem. The
     Ceph Client is the user of the Ceph file system. The Ceph Metadata Daemon
     provides the metadata services, while the Ceph Object Storage Daemon
     provides the actual storage (for both data and metadata). Finally, the
     Ceph Monitor provides cluster management. Note that there can be many Ceph
     clients, many object storage endpoints, numerous metadata servers
     (depending on the capacity of the file system), and at least a redundant
     pair of monitors. So, how is this file system distributed? </p>

    ecosystem</b></a><br>

<h4><a name="client"><span class="smalltitle">Ceph client</span></a></h4>
 
    <a name="kernel"></a>
<h5>Kernel or user space</h5>
     
     <p>Early versions of Ceph utilized Filesystems in User SpacE (FUSE), which
    pushes the file system into user space and can greatly simplify its
    development. But today, Ceph has been integrated into the mainline
    kernel, making it faster, because user space context switches are no
    longer necessary for file system I/O. </p>
    </div></div>
 
 <p>As Linux presents a common interface to the file systems (through the
     virtual file system switch [VFS]), the user's perspective of Ceph is
     transparent. The administrator's perspective will certainly differ, given
     the potential for many servers encompassing the storage system (see the 
     <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section for information on creating a
     Ceph cluster). From the users' point of view, they have access to a large
     storage system and are not aware of the underlying metadata servers,
     monitors, and individual object storage devices that aggregate into a
     massive storage pool. Users simply see a mount point, from which
     standard file I/O can be performed. </p>
 <p>The Ceph file system - or at least the client interface - is
     implemented in the Linux kernel. Note that in the vast majority of file
     systems, all of the control and intelligence is implemented within the
     kernel's file system source itself. But with Ceph, the file system's
     intelligence is distributed across the nodes, which simplifies the client
     interface but also provides Ceph with the ability to massively scale (even
     dynamically). </p>
 <p>Rather than rely on allocation lists (metadata to map blocks on a disk to a
     given file), Ceph uses an interesting alternative. A file from the Linux
     perspective is assigned an inode number (INO) from the metadata server,
     which is a unique identifier for the file. The file is then carved into
     some number of objects (based on the size of the file). Using the INO and
     the object number (ONO), each object is assigned an object ID (OID). Using
     a simple hash over the OID, each object is assigned to a placement group.
     The <em>placement group</em> (identified as a PGID) is a conceptual
     container for objects. Finally, the mapping of the placement group to
     object storage devices is a pseudo-random mapping using an algorithm called
    <em>Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing</em> (CRUSH). In
     this way, mapping of placement groups (and replicas) to storage devices
     does not rely on any metadata but instead on a pseudo-random mapping function.
     This behavior is ideal, because it minimizes the overhead of storage and
     simplifies the distribution and lookup of data. </p>
 <p>The final component for allocation is the cluster map. The <em>cluster
    map</em> is an efficient representation of the devices representing
     the storage cluster. With a PGID and the cluster map, you can locate any
     object. </p>
         
 <h5><a name="metadata_server"><span class="smalltitle">The Ceph metadata
     server</span></a></h5>
 <p>The job of the metadata server (cmds) is to manage the file system's
     namespace. Although both metadata and data are stored in the object
     storage cluster, they are managed separately to support scalability. In
     fact, metadata is further split among a cluster of metadata servers that
     can adaptively replicate and distribute the namespace to avoid hot spots.
     As shown in Figure 4, the metadata servers manage portions of the
     namespace and can overlap (for redundancy and also for performance). The
     mapping of metadata servers to namespace is performed in Ceph using
     dynamic subtree partitioning, which allows Ceph to adapt to changing
     workloads (migrating namespaces between metadata servers) while preserving
     locality for performance. </p>
 
     <br><a name="fig4"><b>Figure 4. Partitioning of the Ceph
    namespace for metadata servers</b></a><br>
     <img alt="Diagram showing the partitions of the Ceph namespace for metadata 
      servers" 
      src="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-ceph/figure4.gif" 
      height="249" width="458">
 <br>
 <p>But because each metadata server simply manages the namespace for the
     population of clients, its primary application is an intelligent metadata
     cache (because actual metadata is eventually stored within the object
     storage cluster). Metadata to write is cached in a short-term journal,
     which eventually is pushed to physical storage. This behavior allows the
     metadata server to serve recent metadata back to clients (which is common
     in metadata operations). The journal is also useful for failure recovery: 
     if the metadata server fails, its journal can be replayed to ensure
     that metadata is safely stored on disk. </p>
 <p>Metadata servers manage the inode space, converting file names to metadata.
     The metadata server transforms the file name into an inode, file size, and
     striping data (layout) that the Ceph client uses for file I/O. </p>
 <h5><a name="monitors"><span class="smalltitle">Ceph monitors</span></a></h5>
 <p>Ceph includes monitors that implement management of the cluster map, but  
some elements of fault management are implemented in the
     object store itself. When object storage devices fail or new devices are
     added, monitors detect and maintain a valid cluster map. This function is
     performed in a distributed fashion where map updates are communicated with
     existing traffic. Ceph uses Paxos, which is a family of algorithms for
     distributed consensus. </p>
 <h5><a name="object_storage">Ceph object storage</a></h5>
 <p>Similar to traditional object storage, Ceph storage nodes include not only
     storage but also intelligence. Traditional drives are simple targets that
     only respond to commands from initiators. But object storage devices are
     intelligent devices that act as both targets and initiators to support
     communication and collaboration with other object storage devices. </p>
 <p>From a storage perspective, Ceph object storage devices perform the mapping
     of objects to blocks (a task traditionally done at the file system layer
     in the client). This behavior allows the local entity to best decide how
     to store an object. Early versions of Ceph implemented a custom low-level
     file system on the local storage called <em>EBOFS</em>. This system
     implemented a nonstandard interface to the underlying storage tuned for
     object semantics and other features (such as asynchronous notification of
     commits to disk). Today, the B-tree file system (BTRFS) can be used at the
     storage nodes, which already implements some of the necessary features
     (such as embedded integrity). </p>
 <p>Because the Ceph clients implement CRUSH and do not have knowledge of the
     block mapping of files on the disks, the underlying storage devices can
     safely manage the mapping of objects to blocks. This allows the storage
     nodes to replicate data (when a device is found to have failed).
     Distributing the failure recovery also allows the storage system to scale,
     because failure detection and recovery are distributed across the
     ecosystem. Ceph calls this RADOS (see <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). </p>
<h5><a name="features">Other features of interest</a></h5>
 <p>As if the dynamic and adaptive nature of the file system weren't enough,
     Ceph also implements some interesting features visible to the user. Users
     can create snapshots, for example, in Ceph on any subdirectory (including
     all of the contents). It's also possible to perform file and capacity
     accounting at the subdirectory level, which reports the storage size and
     number of files for a given subdirectory (and all of its nested contents). </p>
<h5><a name="status"><span class="atitle">Ceph status and future</span></a></h5>
 <p>Although Ceph is now integrated into the mainline Linux kernel, it's
     properly noted there as experimental. File systems in this state are
     useful to evaluate but are not yet ready for production environments. But
     given Ceph's adoption into the Linux kernel and the motivation by its
     originators to continue its development, it should be available soon to
     solve your massive storage needs. </p>
<h5><a name="other"><span class="atitle">Other distributed file systems</span></a></h5>
 <p>Ceph isn't unique in the distributed file system space, but it is unique in
     the way that it manages a large storage ecosystem. Other examples of
     distributed file systems include the Google File System (GFS), the General
     Parallel File System (GPFS), and Lustre, to name just a few. The ideas
     behind Ceph appear to offer an interesting future for distributed file
     systems, as massive scales introduce unique challenges to the massive
     storage problem. </p>
<h5><a name="N1017D"><span class="atitle">Going further</span></a></h5>
 <p>Ceph is not only a file system
     but an object storage ecosystem with enterprise-class features. In the 
     <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section, you'll find information on
     how to set up a simple Ceph cluster (including metadata servers, object
     servers, and monitors). Ceph fills a gap in distributed storage, and it
     will be interesting to see how the open source offering evolves in the
     future. </p>

<p>Cloud computing is, without a doubt, the IT topic of our time. No 
issue pushes infrastructure managers with large-scale enterprises as 
hard as how to best implement the cloud. The IaaS principle is quite 
simple: The goal is to provide capacity to users in the form of 
computational power and storage in a way that means as little work as 
possible for the user and that keeps the entire platform as flexible as 
possible.</p><p>Put more tangibly, this means customers can request CPU 
cycles and disk space as they see fit and continue to use both as the 
corresponding services are needed. For IT service providers, this means 
defining your own setup to be as scalable as possible: It should be 
possible to accommodate peak loads without difficulty, and if the 
platform grows - which will be the objective of practically any 
enterprise - a permanent extension should also be accomplished easily.</p><p>In
 practical terms, implementing this kind of solution will tend to be 
more complex. Scalable virtualization environments are something that is
 easy to achieve: Xen and KVM, in combination with the current crop of 
management tools, make it easy to manage virtualization hosts. Scale out
 also is no longer an issue: If the platform needs more computational 
performance, you can add more machines that integrate seamlessly with 
the existing infrastructure.</p><p>Things start to become more 
interesting when you look at storage. The way IT environments store data
 has remained virtually unchanged in the past few years. In the early 
1990s, data centers comprised many servers with local storage, all of 
which suffered from legacy single points of failure. As of the 
mid-1990s, Fibre Channel HBAs and matching SAN storage entered the 
scene, offering far more redundancy than their predecessors, but at a 
far higher price. People who preferred a lower budget approach turned to
<a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRBD">DRBD</a> with standard hardware 
a few years ago, thus avoiding what can be hugely expensive SANs. However, all 
of these approaches share a problem: They do not scale out seamlessly.</p>
<h4>Scale Out and Scale Up</h4>
<p>Admins
 and IT managers distinguish between two basic types of scalability. 
Vertical scalability (scale up) is based on the idea of extending the 
resources of existing devices, whereas horizontal scalability (scale 
out) relies on adding more resources to the existing set (Figure 1). 
Databases are a classic example of a scale-out solution: Typically, 
slave servers are added to support load distribution.</p>

</div>
</div><p>Scale out is completely new ground when it comes to storage. 
Local storage in servers, SAN storage, or servers with DRBD will 
typically only scale vertically (more disks!), not horizontally. When 
the case is full, you need a second storage device, and this will not 
typically support integration with the existing storage to provide a 
single unit, thus making maintenance far more difficult. In terms of SAN
 storage, two SANs just cost twice as much as one.</p>

storage, don't become despondent at this point: Authors of the popular 
cloud applications are fully aware of this problem and now offer 
workable solutions known as object stores.</p><p>Object stores follow a 
simple principle: All servers that become part of an object store run 
software that manages and exports the server's local disk space. All 
instances of this software collaborate on the cluster, thus providing 
the illusion of a single, large data store. To support internal storage 
management, the object store software does not save data in its original
 format on the individual storage nodes, but as binary objects. Most 
exciting is that the number of individual nodes joining forces to create
 the large object store is arbitrary. You can even add storage nodes on 
the fly.</p><p>Because the object storage software also has internal 
mechanisms to handle redundancy, and the whole thing works with standard
 hardware, a solution of this kind combines the benefits of SANs or DRBD
 storage and seamless horizontal scalability. RADOS has set out to be 
the king of the hill in this sector, in combination with the matching 
Ceph filesystem.</p>
<h4>How RADOS Works</h4>
<p>RADOS (reliable autonomic distributed object store, although many people 
mistakenly say "autonomous") has been under development at DreamHost, led by 
Sage A. Weil, for a number of years and is basically the result of a doctoral 
thesis at the University of California, Santa Cruz. RADOS implements 
precisely the functionality of an object store as described earlier, 
distinguishing between three different layers to do so:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Object Storage Devices (OSDs). An OSD in RADOS is always a folder 
within an existing filesystem. All OSDs together form the object store 
proper, and the binary objects that RADOS generates from the files to be
 stored reside in the store. The hierarchy within the OSDs is flat: 
files with UUID-style names but no subfolders.</li>
  <li>Monitoring servers (MONs): MONs form the interface to the RADOS 
store and support access to the objects within the store. They handle 
communication with all external applications and work in a decentralized
 way: There are no restrictions in terms of numbers, and any client can 
talk to any MON. MONs manage the MONmap (a list of all MONs) and the 
OSDmap (a list of all OSDs). The information from these two lists lets 
clients compute which OSD they need to contact to access a specific 
file. In the style of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_%28computer_science%29">Paxos</a> 
cluster, MONs also ensure RADOS's functionality in terms of respecting 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_%28distributed_computing%29">quorum 
rules<a>.</li>
  <li>Metadata servers (MDS): MDSs provide POSIX metadata for objects in the 
RADOS object store for Ceph clients.</li>
</ol>
<h4>What About Ceph?</h4>
<p>Most articles about RADOS just refer to Ceph in the title, causing some 
confusion. Weil described the relationship between RADOS and Ceph as two parts 
of the same solution: RADOS is the "lower" part and Ceph the "upper" part. One 
thing is for sure: The best looking object store in the world is useless if it 
doesn't give you any options for accessing the data you store in it.</p>
<p>However, it is precisely these options that Ceph offers for RADOS: It is 
a filesystem that accesses the object store in the background and thus 
makes its data directly usable in the application. The metadata servers 
help accomplish this task by providing the metadata required for each 
file that Ceph accesses in line with the POSIX standard when a user 
requests a file via Ceph.</p><p>Because DreamHost didn't consider until 
some later stage of development that RADOS could be used as a back end 
for tools other than filesystems, they generated confusion regarding the
 names of RADOS and Ceph. For example, the official DreamHost guides 
refer simply to "Ceph" when they actually mean "RADOS and Ceph."</p>
<h4>First RADOS Setup</h4>
<p>Theory is one thing, but to gain some understanding of RADOS and Ceph, 
it makes much more sense to experiment on a "live object." You don't need 
much for a complete RADOS-Ceph setup: Three servers with local storage 
will do fine. Why three? Remember that RADOS autonomically provides a 
high-availability option. The MONs use the PAXOS implementation referred
 to earlier to guarantee that there will always be more than one copy of
 an object in a RADOS cluster. Although you could turn a single node 
into a RADOS store, this wouldn't give you much in the line of high 
availability. A RADOS cluster comprising two nodes is even more 
critical: In a normal case, the cluster would have a quorum, but the 
failure of a single node would then make the other node useless because 
RADOS needs a quorum, and by definition, one can't make a quorum. In 
other words, you need three nodes to be on the safe side, so the failure
 of single node won't be an issue.</p><p>Incidentally, nothing can stop 
you from using virtual machines with RADOS for your experiments - RADOS 
doesn't have any functions that require specific hardware features.</p>
<h4>Finding the Software</h4>
<p>Before experimenting, you need to install RADOS and Ceph. Ceph, which is 
a plain vanilla filesystem driver on Linux systems (e.g., ext3 or ext4), 
made its way into the Linux kernel in Linux 2.6.34 and is thus available
 for any distribution with this or a later kernel version (Figure 2). 
The situation isn't quite as easy with RADOS; however, the 
<a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/docs/master/install/" 
target="_blank">documentation</a> points to prebuilt packages, or at least gives 
you an installation guide, for all of the popular distributions. Note that although 
the documentation refers to "ceph," the packages contain all of the 
components you need for RADOS. After installing the packages, it's time 
to prepare RADOS.</p>

<p>Figure 2: After loading the ceph kernel module, the filesystem is available 
on Linux. Ceph was first introduced in kernel 2.6.34.</p>
 </div>
<h4>Preparing the OSDs</h4>
<p>RADOS needs OSDs. As I mentioned earlier, any folder on a filesystem can act as 
an OSD; however, the filesystem must support extended attributes. The RADOS authors 
recommend Btrfs but also mention XFS as an alternative for anyone who is still a bit 
wary of using Btrfs. For simplicity's sake, I will assume in the following examples 
that you have a directory named <i>osd.ID</i> in <i>/srv</i> on three servers, where 
<i>ID </i> stands for the server's hostname in each case. If your three servers are 
named <i>alice</i>, <i>bob</i>, and <i>charlie</i>, you would have a folder named 
<i>/srv/osd.alice</i> on server <i>alice</i>, and so on.</p><p>If you will be using 
a local filesystem set up specially for this purpose, be sure to mount it in 
<i>/srv/osd.ID</i>. Finally, each of the hosts in <i>/srv</i> also needs a 
<i>mon.ID</i> folder, where <i>ID</i> again stands for the hostname.</p><p>In this 
sample setup, the central RADOS configuration in <i>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</i> might 
look like Listing 1.</p>
<h4>Listing 1: Sample <i>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</i></h4>
<pre>[global]
   auth supported = cephx
   keyring = /etc/ceph/$name.keyring
[mon]
   mon data = /srv/mon.$id
[mds]
[osd]
   osd data = /srv/osd.$id
   osd journal = /srv/osd.$id.journal
   osd journal size = 1000
[mon.a]
   host = alice
   mon addr = 10.42.0.101:6789
[mon.b]
   host = bob
   mon addr = 10.42.0.102:6789
[mon.c]
   host = charlie
   mon addr = 10.42.0.103:6789
[osd.0]
   host = alice
[osd.1]
   host = bob
[osd.2]
   host = charlie
[mds.a]
   host = alice</pre><p>The configuration file defines the following details: each of the three hosts provides an OSD and a MON server; host <i>alice</i>
 is also running an MDS to ensure that any Ceph clients will find 
POSIX-compatible metadata on access. Authentication between the nodes is
 encrypted: The keyring for this is stored in the <i>/etc/ceph</i> folder and goes by the name of <i>$name.keyring</i>, where RADOS will automatically replace <i>name</i> with the actual value later.</p><p>Most importantly, the nodes in the RADOS cluster must reach one another directly using the hostnames from your <i>ceph.conf</i> file. This could mean adding these names to your <i>/etc/hosts</i> file. Additionally, you need to be able to log in to all of the RADOS nodes as <i>root</i> later on for the call to <i>mkcephfs</i>, and root needs to be able to call <i>sudo</i>
 without an additional password prompt on all of the nodes. After 
fulfilling these conditions, the next step is to create the keyring to 
support mutual authentication between the RADOS nodes:</p><pre>mkcephfs -a -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf -k /etc/ceph/admin.keyring</pre><p>Now you need to ensure that <i>ceph.conf</i>
 exists on all the hosts belonging to the cluster (Figure 3). If this is
 the case, you just need to start RADOS on all of the nodes: Typing</p><pre>/etc/init.d/ceph start</pre><p>will do the trick. After a couple of seconds, the three nodes should have joined the cluster; you can check this by typing</p><pre>ceph -k /etc/ceph/admin.keyring -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf health</pre><p>which should give you the output shown in Figure 4.</p>

<h4>Using Ceph to Mount the Filesystem</h4>
<p>To mount the newly created filesystem on another host on one of the RADOS nodes, 
you can use the normal <i>mount</i> command - the target host is one of the MON 
servers (i.e., <i>alice</i> in this example) with a MON address set to 
<i>10.42.0.101:6789</i> in <i>ceph.conf</i>.  Because Cephx authentication is being 
used, I need to identify the login credentials automatically generated by Ceph before 
I can mount the filesystem. The following command on one of the RADOS nodes outputs 
the credentials:</p><pre>ceph-authtool -l /etc/ceph/admin.keyring</pre><p>The mount 
process then follows:</p>
<pre>mount -t ceph 10.0.0.1:6789:/ /mnt/osd -vv -o name=admin,secret=mykey</pre>
<p>where <i>mykey</i> needs to be replaced by the value for <i>key</i> that you 
determined with the last command. The mountpoint in this example is <i>/mnt/osd</i>, 
which can be used it as a normal directory from now on.</p>
<h4>The Crush Map</h4>
<p>RADOS and Ceph use a fair amount of magic in the background to safeguard 
the setup against any kind of failure, starting with the mount. Any of the 
existing MON servers can act as a mountpoint; however, this doesn't mean
 communications are only channeled between the client and this one MON. 
Instead, Ceph on the client receives the MON and OSDmaps from the MON 
server it contacts and then references them to compute which OSD is best
 to use for a specific file before going on to handle the communication 
with this OSD.</p><p>The <i>Crush map</i> is another step for improving 
redundancy. It defines which hosts belong to a RADOS cluster, how many 
OSDs exist in the cluster, and how to distribute the files over these 
hosts for best effect. The Crush map makes RADOS rack-aware, allowing 
admins to manipulate the internal replication of RADOS in terms of 
individual servers, racks, or security zones in the data center. The 
setup shown for the example here also has a rudimentary default Crush 
map. If you want to experiment with your own Crush map, the 
<a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki/Custom_data_placement_with_CRUSH" 
target="_blank">Ceph wiki</a> gives you the most important information for 
getting started.</p>
<h4>Extending the Existing Setup</h4>
<p>How do you go about extending an existing RADOS cluster, by adding more 
nodes to increase the amount of available storage? If you want to add a 
node named <i>daisy</i> to the existing setup, the first step would be 
to define an ID for this node. In this example, IDs 0 through 3 are 
already assigned, and the new node would have an ID of 4, so you need to
type:</p><pre>ceph osd create 4</pre><p>Then you need to extend the 
<i>ceph.conf</i> files on the existing cluster nodes, adding an entry for 
daisy. On daisy, you also need to create the folder structure needed for daisy 
to act as an OSD (i.e., the directories in <i>/srv</i>, as in the previous examples). 
Next, copy the new <i>ceph.conf</i> to the <i>/etc/ceph</i> folder on daisy.</p>
<p>Daisy also needs to know the current MON structure - after all, she will need
to register with an existing MON later on. This means daisy needs the current 
MONmap for the RADOS cluster. You can read the MONmap on one of the existing RADOS 
nodes by typing</p><pre>ceph mon getmap -o /tmp/monmap</pre><p>(Figure 5), and then 
use <i>scp</i> to copy it to daisy (this example assumes you are storing the MONmap 
in <i>/tmp/monmap</i> on daisy). Now, you need to initialize the OSD directory on 
daisy:</p>
<pre>ceph-osd -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf -i 4 --mkfs --monmap /tmp/monmap --mkkey</pre>
<p>If the additional cluster node uses an ID other than <i>4</i>, you need to modify 
the numeric value that follows <i>-i</i>.</p>
<div class="" id=""><div class="content-view-embed">
<div class="class-image">
<div class="attribute-image">

<div class="attribute-caption" style="width: 600px">
<p>Figure 5: The MONmap contains information about MONs in the RADOS cluster. New OSDs rely on this information.</p>
 </div>
         </div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, you need to introduce the existing cluster to daisy. In this example, 
the last command created a <i>/etc/ceph/osd.4.keyring</i> file on daisy, which you 
can copy to one of the existing MONs with <i>scp</i>. Following this,</p>
<pre>ceph auth add osd.ID osd 'allow *' mon 'allow rwx' -i /etc/ceph/osd.4.keyring</pre>
<p>on the same node adds the new OSD to the existing authentication structure 
(Figure 6). Typing <i>/etc/init.d/ceph</i> on daisy launches RADOS, and the new OSD 
registers with the existing RADOS cluster. The final step is to modify the existing 
Crush map so the new OSD is used. In this example, you would type</p><pre>ceph osd 
crush add 4 osd.4 1.0 pool=default host=daisy</pre><p>to do this. The new OSD is now 
part of the existing RADOS/Ceph cluster.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>It isn't difficult to set up the combination of RADOS and Ceph. But this simple 
configuration doesn't leverage many of the exciting features that RADOS offers. For 
example, the Crush map functionality gives you the option of deploying huge RADOS
setups over multiple racks in the data center while offering intelligent failsafes. 
Because RADOS also offers you the option of dividing its storage into individual 
pools of variable sizes, you can achieve more granularity in terms of different 
tasks and target groups.</p>
<p>Also, I haven't looked at the RADOS front ends beyond Ceph. After all, Ceph 
is just one front end of many; in this case, it supports access to files
in the object store via the Linux filesystem. However, more options for
 accessing the data on RADOS exist. The RADOS block device, or <i>rbd</i>
 for short, is a good choice when you need to support access to files in
 the object store at the block device level. For example, this would be 
the case for virtual machines that will typically accept block devices 
as a back end for virtual disks, thus avoiding slower solutions with 
disk images. In this way, you can exploit RADOS's potential as an 
all-encompassing storage system for large virtualization solutions while
 solving another problem in the context of the cloud.</p><p>Speaking of the cloud, 
besides <i>rbd</i>, <i>librados</i> provides various interfaces for HTTP access - 
for example, a variant compatible with Amazon's S3 and a Swift-compatible variant. 
A generic REST interface is also available. As you can see, RADOS has a good 
selection of interfaces to the world outside.</p><p>At the time of 
writing, the RADOS Ceph components were still pre-series, but the 
developers were looking to release version 1.0, which could already be 
available as officially stable and "enterprise-ready."</p>

A Basic Ceph Storage &amp; KVM Virtualisation Tutorial
<a href="http://blog.bob.sh/2012/02/basic-ceph-storage-kvm-virtualisation.html"
target="newwindow">(Source Origin)</a></h3>  
  <div class="article-content entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I had been meaning to give <a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/">CEPH</a>
 &amp; KVM Virtualisation a whirl in the lab for quite some time now. 
Here I have provided for you all a set of command-by-command 
instructions I used for setting it up on a single host. The goal here is
 really just to get it to the 'working' stage for some basic functional 
experimentation.
<P> Ideally you would want to set this up on multiple hosts with proper 
network separation so you can see how it performs with real-world 
attenuation.
<h4>Overview</h4>
For those who don't know it, CEPH is a distributed storage solution that
 allows you to scale horizontally with multiple machines/heads instead 
of the more traditional methodologies which use centralised heads with 
large amounts of storage attached to them.
<P> The principle here is that you should be able to buy lots of inexpensive
 computers with a bunch of direct attached storage and just cluster them
 to achieve scalability. Also, without a central point of failure or 
performance bottleneck you should be able to scale beyond the 
limitations of our past storage architectures.
<P> So CEPH like most distributed storage solutions, really has 3 main components:
<ul>
   <li><b>Object Storage Device (OSD):</b> this is where the blocks get stored. You 
       would usually have lots of these.</li>
   <li><b>Meta-Data Server (MDS):</b> This where the metadata gets stored. 
       You would have less of these. They are used for looking up where the 
       blocks are stored and storing meta-data about files and blocks.</li>
    <li><b>Monitor (MON):</b> Cluster management, configuration and state. This 
       component keeps track of the state of the clustering really.</li>
</ul>
<P> Here is a basic diagram provided from the official site (so yes I stole it - I 
hope thats okay):
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<img src="http://ceph.newdream.net/w/images/f/f6/Ceph_architecture.png" 
height="259" border="0" width="640"></div>
<P> As you can see, ideally these components are meant to be ran on different sets 
of systems, with the OSD component being the most frequent. I'm just going to run 
them all on the same host for this demo, which is useful for a functional test, but 
not for a destructive or performance test.
<P> By the way the OSD part can used different types of backends and filesystems 
for storage, but in this example I've chosen BTRFS.
<P> So CEPH itself supports multiple different ways of mounting its storage, which 
makes it quite a flexible solution.
<P> In this demo I'm going to concentrate only on the RBD and Ceph DFS mechanisms.
<P> This installation was tested with:
<ul>
   <li>ceph 0.4.0</li>
   <li>qemu-kvm 1.0</li>
   <li>libvirt 0.9.8</li>
   <li>debian 7.0 (wheezy)</li>
</ul>
<P> I'm using the bleeding edge versions of these components because CEPH is really 
in heavy development its better to see how the main-line of development works to get 
a clearer picture.
<h4>OS Preparation</h4>
<P> It was tested with real hardware hosted by Hetzner in Germany. The box specs were 
roughly something like:
<ul>
<li>Quad-Core processor</li>
<li>16 GB of RAM</li>
<li>2 x 750 GB disks (no hardware raid)</li>
</ul>
<P> To begin, I personally built a Debian 6.0 system (because thats all Hetzner 
offers you within its Robot tool) with a spare partition that I later use for the 
OSD/BTRFS volume. The layout was something like:
<ul>
   <li><b>/dev/md0:</b> /boot, 512MB</li>
   <li><b>/dev/md1:</b> LVM, 74 GB</li>
   <li><b>/dev/md2:</b> the rest of the disk</li>
</ul>
<P> And in the LVM partition I defined the following logical volumes:
<ul>
   <li><b>/:</b> 50 GB (ext4)</li>
   <li><b>swap:</b> 20 GB</li>
</ul>
<P> The device /dev/md2 I reserved for BTRFS. I believe a more optimal configuration 
is to not use an MD device but just use /dev/sda2 &amp; /dev/sda3 and let BTRFS do 
the mirroring. I however have no data or performance statistics to prove this at the 
moment.
<P> To get the system upgraded from Debian 6 to 7 is fairly straight-forward. First 
update the APT sources list.
<br>
<b>/etc/apt/sources.list:</b>
<PRE>
 deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free
 deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-proposed-updates main contrib non-free
</PRE>
<P>Then run the following to then get the latest updates:
<PRE>
 $ apt-get update
 $ apt-get -y dist-upgrade
</PRE>
<P> The kernel would have been upgraded so you should reboot at this point.
<h4>CEPH Installation</h4>
<P> Install CEPH using the ceph package. This should pull in all the dependencies 
  you need.
<PRE>
 $ apt-get install ceph</span>
</PRE>
<P> Create some directories for the various CEPH components:
<PRE>
 $ mkdir -p /srv/ceph/{osd,mon,mds}
</PRE>
<P>I used a configuration file like this below. Obviously you will need to change the 
various parts to suit your environment. I've left out authentication in this demo for 
simplicity, although if you want to do real destructive and load-testing you should 
always include this.
<div>
<b>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf:</b></div>
<PRE>
[global]
    log file = /var/log/ceph/$name.log
    pid file = /var/run/ceph/$name.pid
[mon]
    mon data = /srv/ceph/mon/$name
    [mon.&lt;your_short_hostname&gt;]
    host = &lt;your_hostname&gt;
    mon addr = &lt;your_ip_address&gt;:6789
[mds]
    [mds.&lt;your_short_hostname&gt;]
    host = &lt;your_hostname&gt;
[osd]
    osd data = /srv/ceph/osd/$name
    osd journal = /srv/ceph/osd/$name/journal
    osd journal size = 1000 ; journal size, in megabytes
[osd.0]
    host = &lt;your_hostname&gt;
    btrfs devs = /dev/md2
    btrfs options = rw,noatime
</PRE>
<P> Now for configuration, CEPH chooses to try and SSH into remote boxes and configure 
things. I believe this is nice for people who are just getting started, but I'm not 
sure if this is correct going forward if you already have your own Configuration 
Management tool like <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/whats-new/" 
target="newwindow">Puppet</a>, <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/" 
target="newwindow">Puppet Docs</a>, <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/" 
target="newwindow">Chef</a> or <a href="https://cfengine.com/manuals/cf3-tutorial" 
target="newwindow">CFEngine Turo</a> <a href="https://cfengine.com/" 
target="newwindow">CFEngine</a>.
<P> So to begin with, there is a command that will initialise your CEPH filesystems 
based on the configuration you have provided:
<PRE>
 $ /sbin/mkcephfs -a -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf --mkbtrfs --no-copy-conf
</PRE>
<P> Starting the daemon was a little strange (see the -a switch?):
<PRE>
 $ /etc/init.d/ceph -a start
</PRE>
<P> So just to test its all working, lets mount the CEPH DFS volume onto the 
local system:
<PRE>
 $ mount -t ceph &lt;your_hostname&gt;:/ /mnt
</PRE>
<P> What you are looking at here is the CEPH object store mounted in /mnt. This is 
a shared object store - and you should be able to have multiple hosts mount it just 
like NFS. As mentioned before-hand however, this is not the only way of getting 
access to the CEPH storage cluster.
<h4>CEPH DFS &amp; Directory Snapshots</h4>
<P> So I just wanted to segway a little and talk about this neat feature. 
CEPH &amp; the ceph based mount point above has the capability to do 
per-directory snapshots which could come in useful. The interface is 
quite simple as well.

 $ mkdir /mnt/test
 $ cd /mnt/test
 $ touch a b c
 $ mkdir .snap/my_snapshot
</PRE>
<div>
<b>deleting a snapshot:</b></div>
<PRE>
 $ rmdir .snap/my_snapshot
</PRE>
<div>
<b>finding a snapshot:</b></div>
<P> The .snap directory won't show up when you do a ls -la in the dir.
<P> Simply assume its there and do something like:
<PRE>
 $ ls -la .snap
</PRE>
<P> ... in the directory and the snapshots should show up under the names you created 
them with.
<h4>RADOS Block Device</h4>
<P> So an alternative way of using your CEPH storage is by using RBD. The RBD interface 
gives you the capability to expose an object onto a remote system as a block device. 
Obviously this has the same caveats as any block device, so multiple hosts that mount 
the same device must ensure they use some sort of clustered file system such as OCFS2.
<P> So first if its not already, load the rbd kernel module:
<PRE>
 $ modprobe rbd
</PRE>
<P> Using the 'rbd' command line tool, create an image (size is in megs):
<PRE>
 $ rbd create mydisk --size 10000
</PRE>
<P> You can list the current images if you want:
<PRE>
 $ rbd list
</PRE>
<P> Now to mount the actually device, you just have to tell the kernel first:
<PRE>
 $ echo "&lt;your_ip_address&gt; name=admin rbd mydisk" &gt; /sys/bus/rbd/add
</PRE>
<P> It should create a device like /dev/rbd/rbd/mydisk. Lets now&nbsp;format it with 
a real filesystem and mount it:
<PRE>
  $ mkfs -t ext4 /dev/rbd/rbd/mydisk
  $ mkdir /srv/mydisk
  $ mount -t ext4 /dev/rbd/rbd/mydisk /srv/mydisk
</PRE>
<h4>KVM/Qemu Support</h4>
<P> QEMU (and libvirt for that matter) at some point merged in patched to 
allow you to specify an 'rbd' store as a backend to a QEMU virtual 
instance. I'm going to focus on using an Intel/KVM image for this 
tutorial.
<P> So lets start by installing KVM &amp; Qemu and the various other pieces 
we'll need:
<PRE>
 $ apt-get install kvm libvirt-bin virtinst iptables-persistent
</PRE>
<P> We want to probably create a pool for vm disks separate from the pre-existing 
ones. You can create as many of these as you need:
<PRE>
 $ rados mkpool vm_disks
</PRE>
<P> Now create a qemu image inside the pool. Notice we are just using 'qemu-image' 
to do this?
<PRE>
 $ qemu-img create -f rbd rbd:vm_disks/box1_disk1 10G
</PRE>
<P> Create yourself a bridge network by modifying the correct Debian configuration 
file.
<div>
<b>/etc/network/interfaces:</b></div>
<PRE>
auto virbr0
iface virbr0 inet static
&nbsp; bridge_ports none
&nbsp; address 192.168.128.1
&nbsp; netmask 255.255.255.0
&nbsp; network 192.168.128.0
&nbsp; broadcast 192.168.128.255
</PRE>
<P> And now bring up the interface:</div>
<PRE>
 $ ifup --verbose virbr0
</PRE>
<P> We'll need some firewall rules so that NAT works in this case. Obviously your 
network needs may vary here.
<div>
<b>/etc/iptables/rules.v4:</b></div>
<PRE>
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A FORWARD -s 192.168.128.0/24 -m comment --comment "100 allow forwarding from internal" -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -d 192.168.128.0/24 -m comment --comment "100 allow forwarding to internal" -j ACCEPT
COMMIT
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.128.0/24 -o eth0 -m comment --comment "500 outbound nat for internal" -j MASQUERADE
COMMIT
</PRE>
<P> And restart iptables-persistent to load the rules:
<PRE>
 $ service iptables-persistent restart
</PRE>
<P> Turn on forwarding for IPv4:</div>
<PRE>
 $ echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</PRE>
<P> Now that the network is done, we want to create a script to help us launch our 
VM instance.
<P> First of all create a device definition file called disk.xml with the following 
contents. This allows us to work-around limitations in virt-install, as it doesn't 
yet support these extra options as command-line arguments.
<div>
<b>/root/disk.xml:</b></div>
<PRE>
&lt;disk type='network' device='disk'&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;source protocol='rbd' name='vm_disks/box1_disk1'/&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/&gt;
&lt;/disk&gt;
</PRE>
<P> Now lets create our script.
<div>
<b>/root/virt.sh:</b></div>
<div>
<PRE>
#!/bin/bash
set -x
virt-install \
  --name=box1 \
  --ram=512 \
  --vcpus=1 \
  --location=http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy/main/installer-amd64/ \
  --extra-args="console=ttyS0" \
  --serial=pty \

  --nodisks
# This is because virt-install doesn't support passing rbd&nbsp;
# style disk settings yet.
# Attaching it quickly before system boot however seems to work
virsh attach-device box1 disk.xml --persistent
</PRE>
<P> And finally we should be able to run it:
<PRE>
./virt.sh
</PRE>
<P> Now attach to the console and go through the standard installation steps for 
the OS.
<PRE>
virsh console box1
</PRE>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KPRCdNFZ44A/Ty748m3pcQI/AAAAAAAAB2o/Yxll4XwL7tA/s640/Screen+Shot+2012-02-05+at+21.46.25.png" height="388" border="0" width="640"></div>
<P> <b>Note:</b>&nbsp;There is no DHCP or DNS server setup - for this test I just 
provided a static IP and used my own DNS servers.
<P> As you go through the setup, the RBD disk we defined and created should 
be available like a normal disk as you would expect. After installation 
you shouldn't really notice any major functional difference.
<P> Once installation is complete, you should be able to boot the system:
<PRE>
virsh start box 1
</PRE>
<P>And then access the console:
<PRE>
# virsh console box1

And then your done.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<P> So this is quite an interesting exercise and one worth doing, but the software is 
still very much early-release. They even admit this themselves.
<P> I'm wary of performance and stability more then anything, something I 
can't test with just a single host - so if I ever get the time I'd 
really like to run this thing properly.
<P> I had a brief look at the operations guide, and it seems the 
instructions for adding and removing a host to the OSD cluster looks not
 as automatic as I would like it. Ideally, you really want the kind of 
behaviour that ElasticSearch offers on this level so that adding and 
removing nodes is almost a brain-dead task. Having said that, adding a 
node seems easier then some of the storage systems/solutions I've seen 
about the place :-).
<P> So regardless of my concerns - I think this kind of storage is 
definitely the future and I'm certainly cheering the CEPH team on for 
this one. The functionality was fun (and yes kind of exciting) to play 
with and I can see that the real-world possibilities of such a solution 
in the open-source arena are quite probable now.
<h4>Other things to try from here</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Check out another alternative: 
   <a href="http://www.osrg.net/sheepdog/">Sheepdog</a>, which also seems to be 
      gaining ground but only on the QEMU storage front. Its a very specific solution 
      as apposed to CEPH's generic storage solution.</li>
   <li>Test CEPH integration with OpenNebula and OpenStack so you can see it within a 
      full cloud provisioning case. This might require some custom scripts to support 
      cloning RBD-stored base images etc. but should be interesting.</li>
   <li>Test the <a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki/S3-compatible_Gateway">S3 
      emulation</a> provided by the RadosGW component.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Host Cluster Setup, the easy way</h4>
<p>Fedora has included Ceph for a couple of releases, but since my hosts
 are on Fedora 14/15, I grabbed the latest ceph 0.3.1 sRPMs from Fedora 
16 and rebuilt those to get something reasonably up2date. In the end I 
have the following packages installed, though to be honest I don't 
really need anything except the base 'ceph' RPM:</p>
<pre># rpm -qa | grep ceph | sort
ceph-0.31-4.fc17.x86_64
ceph-debuginfo-0.31-4.fc17.x86_64
ceph-devel-0.31-4.fc17.x86_64
ceph-fuse-0.31-4.fc17.x86_64
ceph-gcephtool-0.31-4.fc17.x86_64
ceph-obsync-0.31-4.fc17.x86_64
ceph-radosgw-0.31-4.fc17.x86_64</pre>
<p>Installing the software is the easy bit, configuring the cluster is 
where the fun begins. I had three hosts available for testing all of 
which are virtualization hosts. Ceph has at least 3 daemons it needs to 
run, which should all be replicated across several hosts for redundancy.
 There's no requirement to use the same hosts for each daemon, but for 
simplicity I decided to run every Ceph daemon on every virtualization 
host.</p>
<p>My hosts are called <code>lettuce</code>, <code>avocado</code> and 
<code>mustard</code>. Following the 
<a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki/Cluster_configuration">Ceph wiki 
instructions</a>, I settled on a configuration file that looks like this:</p>
<pre>[global]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;auth supported = cephx
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring.admin
[mds]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring.$name
[mds.lettuce]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = lettuce
[mds.avocado]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = avocado
[mds.mustard]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = mustard
[osd]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;osd data = /srv/ceph/osd$id
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;osd journal = /srv/ceph/osd$id/journal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; osd journal size = 512
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; osd class dir = /usr/lib64/rados-classes
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring.$name
[osd.0]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = lettuce
[osd.1]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = avocado
[osd.2]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = mustard
[mon]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;mon data = /srv/ceph/mon$id
[mon.0]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = lettuce
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;mon addr = 192.168.1.1:6789
[mon.1]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = avocado
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;mon addr = 192.168.1.2:6789
[mon.2]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;host = mustard
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;mon addr = 192.168.1.3:6789</pre>
<p>The <code>osd class dir</code> bit should not actually be required, but the OSD 
code <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=745460">looks in the wrong 
place</a> (/usr/lib instead of /usr/lib64) on x86_64 arches.</p>
<p>With the configuration file written, it is time to actually 
initialize the cluster filesystem / object store. This is the really fun
 bit. The Ceph wiki has 
<a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki/Creating_a_new_file_system">a very basic 
page</a> which talks about the <code>mkcephfs</code> tool, along with a scary warning 
about how it'll 'rm -rf' all the data on the filesystem it is initializing. It turns 
out that it didn't mean your entire host filesystem, As far as I can tell, it only 
blows away the contents of the directory configured for '<code>osd data</code>' and 
'<code>mon data</code>', in my case both under <code>/srv/ceph</code>.</p>
<p>The recommended way is to let <code>mkcephfs</code> ssh into each of your hosts 
and run all the configuration tasks automatically. Having tried the non-recommended 
way and failed several times before finally getting it right, I can recommend 
following the recommended way :-P There are some caveats not mentioned in the wiki 
page though:</p>
<ul>
<li>The configuration file above must be copied to <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> 
on <strong>every</strong> node <strong>before</strong> attempting to run 
<code>mkcephfs</code>.</li>
<li>The configuration file on the host where you run <code>mkcephfs</code> must be 
in /etc/ceph/ceph.conf or it will get rather confused about where it is in the other 
nodes.</li>
<li>The <code>mkcephfs</code> command must be run as root since, it doesn't specify 
'-l root' to ssh, leading to an inability to setup the nodes.</li>
<li>The directories <code>/srv/ceph/osd$i</code> must be pre-created, since it is 
unable to do that itself, despite being able to creat the 
<code>/srv/ceph/mon$i</code> directories.</li>
<li>The Fedora RPMs have also 
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=745462">forgotten to create 
<code>/etc/ceph</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, I ran the following commands from my laptop, as root</p>
<pre> # n=0
 # for host in lettuce avocado mustard ; \
   do \
       ssh root@$host mkdir -p /etc/ceph /srv/ceph/mon$n; \
       n=$(expr $n + 1); \
       scp /etc/ceph/ceph.conf root@$host:/etc/ceph/ceph.conf
   done
 # mkcephfs -a -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf -k /etc/ceph/keyring.bin</pre>
<p>On the host where you ran <code>mkcephfs</code> there should now be a file 
<code>/etc/ceph/keyring.admin</code>. This will be needed for mounting filesystems. 
I copied it across to all my virtualization hosts</p>
<pre> # for host in lettuce avocado mustard ; \
   do \
       scp /etc/ceph/keyring.admin root@$host:/etc/ceph/keyring.admin; \
   done</pre>
<h4>Host Cluster Usage</h4>
<p>Assuming the setup phase all went to plan, the cluster can now be started. A word of 
warning though, Ceph <strong>really wants your clocks VERY well synchronized</strong>.
 If your NTP server is a long way away, the synchronization might not be good enough 
to stop Ceph complaining. You really want a NTP server on your local LAN for hosts to 
sync against. Sort this out before trying to start the cluster.</p>
<pre> # for host in lettuce avocado mustard ; \
   do \
       ssh root@$host service ceph start; \
   done</pre>
<p>The <code>ceph</code> tool can show the status of everything. The 'mon', 'osd' and 
'msd' lines in the status ought to show all 3 host present &amp; correct</p>
<pre># ceph -s

<p>The cluster configuration I chose has authentication enabled, so to actually mount 
the ceph filesystem requires a secret key. This key is stored in the 
<code>/etc/ceph/keyring.admin</code> file that was created earlier. To view the keyring 
contents, the <code>cauthtool</code> program must be used</p>
<pre># cauthtool -l /etc/ceph/keyring.admin 
[client.admin]
	key = AQDLk5VOeHkHLxAAfGjcaUsOXOhJr7hZCNjXSQ==
	auid = 18446744073709551615</pre>
<p>The base64 key there will be passed to the <code>mount</code> command, repeating on 
every host needing a filesystem present:</p>
<pre># mount -t ceph 192.168.1.1:6789:/ /mnt/ -o name=admin,secret=AQDLk5VOeHkHLxAAfGjcaUsOXOhJr7hZCNjXSQ==
error adding secret to kernel, key name client.admin: No such device</pre>
<p>For some reason, that error message is always printed on my Fedora hosts, and 
despite that, the mount <strong>has actually succeeded</strong></p>
<pre># grep /mnt /proc/mounts 
192.168.1.1:6789:/ /mnt ceph rw,relatime,name=admin,secret= 0 0</pre>
<p>Congratulations, <code>/mnt</code> is now a distributed filesystem. If you create 
a file on one host, it should appear on the other hosts &amp; vica-verca.</p>
<h4>RBD Volume setup</h4>
<p>A shared filesystem is very nice, and can be used to hold regular virtual disk 
images in a variety of formats (raw, qcow2, etc). What I really wanted to try was the 
RBD virtual block device functionality in QEMU. Ceph includes a tool called 
<code>rbd</code> for manipulating those. The syntax of this tool is pretty 
self-explanatory</p>
<pre># rbd create --size 100 demo
# rbd ls
demo
# rbd info demo
rbd image 'demo':
	size 102400 KB in 25 objects
	order 22 (4096 KB objects)
	block_name_prefix: rb.0.0
	parent:  (pool -1)</pre>
<p>Alternatively RBD volume creation can be done using <code>qemu-img</code> ..., 
at least once the Fedora QEMU package is fixed to enable RBD support.</p>
<pre># qemu-img create -f rbd rbd:rbd/demo  100M
Formatting 'rbd:rbd/foo', fmt=rbd size=104857600 cluster_size=0 
# qemu-img info rbd:rbd/demo
image: rbd:rbd/foo
file format: raw
virtual size: 100M (104857600 bytes)
disk size: unavailable</pre>
<h4>KVM guest setup</h4>
<p>The syntax for configuring a RBD block device in libvirt, is very similar to that 
used for Sheepdog. In Sheepdog, every single virtualization node is also a storage 
node, so there is no hostname required. Not so for RBD. Here it is necessary to 
specify one or more host names, for the RBD servers.</p>
<pre>&lt;disk type='network' device='disk'&gt;
  &lt;driver name='qemu' type='raw'/&gt;
  &lt;source protocol='rbd' name='demo/wibble'&gt;
    &lt;host name='lettuce.example.org' port='6798'/&gt;
    &lt;host name='mustard.example.org' port='6798'/&gt;
    &lt;host name='avocado.example.org' port='6798'/&gt;
  &lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;target dev='vdb' bus='virtio'/&gt;
&lt;/disk&gt;
</pre>
<p>More observant people might be wondering how QEMU gets permission to connect to the 
RBD server, given that the configuration earlier enabled authentication. This is thanks 
to the magic of the <code>/etc/ceph/keyring.admin</code> file which must exist on any 
virtualization server. Patches are currently being discussed which will allow 
authentication credentials to be set via libvirt, avoiding the need to store the 
credentials on the virtualization hosts permanently.</p>

<h3>I. Ceph introduction</h3>
<p>Ceph is a massively scalable, open source, distributed storage 
system. It is comprised of an object store, block store, and a 
POSIX-compliant distributed file system. The platform is capable of 
auto-scaling to the exabyte level and beyond, it runs on commodity 
hardware, it is self-healing and self-managing, and has no single point 
of failure. Ceph is in the Linux kernel and is integrated with the 
OpenStack cloud operating system. As a result of its open source 
nature, this portable storage platform may be installed and used in 
public or private clouds.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sebastien-han.fr/images/Ceph-architecture.png"></p>
<h4>I.1. RADOS?</h4>
<p>You can easily get confused by the denomination: Ceph? RADOS?</p>
<p><strong>RADOS: Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store</strong> 
is an object storage. RADOS takes care of distributing the objects 
across the whole storage cluster and replicating them for fault 
tolerance. It is built with 3 major components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object Storage Device (OSD)</strong>: the storage daemon - 
RADOS service, the location of your data. You must have this daemon 
running on each server of your cluster. For each OSD you can have an 
associated hard drive disks. For performance purpose it's usually better
 to pool your hard drive disk with raid arrays, LVM or btrfs pooling. 
With that, for one server your will have one daemon running. By default,
 three pools are created: data, metadata and RBD.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-Data Server (MDS)</strong>: this is where the metadata 
are stored. MDSs build POSIX file system on top of objects for Ceph 
clients. However if you are not using the Ceph File System, you do not 
need a meta data server.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor (MON)</strong>: this lightweight daemon handles all 
the communications with the external applications and the clients. It 
also provides a consensus for distributed decision making in a 
Ceph/RADOS cluster. For instance when you mount a Ceph shared on a 
client you point to the address of a MON server. It checks the state and
 the consistency of the data. In an ideal setup you will at least run 3 
<code>ceph-mon</code> daemons on separate servers. Quorum decisions and 
calculs are elected by a majority vote, we expressly need odd number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ceph devoloppers recommend to use btrfs as a filesystem for the 
storage. Using XFS is also possible and might be a better alternative 
for production environements. Neither Ceph nor Btrfs are ready for 
production. It could be really risky to put them together. This is why 
XFS is an excellent alternative to btrfs. The ext4 filesystem is also 
compatible but doesn't take advantage of all the power of Ceph.</p>
<blockquote><p>We recommend configuring Ceph to use the XFS file system 
in the near term, and btrfs in the long term once it is stable enough 
for production.</p></blockquote>

about usable file system</a></p>
<h4>I.2. Ways to store, use and expose data</h4>
<p>Several ways to store and access your data :)</p>

<li><strong>RADOS</strong>: as an object, default storage mecanism.</li>
<li><strong>RBD</strong>: as a block device. The linux kernel RBD (rados
 block device) driver allows striping a linux block device over multiple

<h4>I.3. IS CEPH PRODUCTION-QUALITY?</h4>
<blockquote><p>The definition of "production quality" varies depending 
on who you ask. Because it can mean a lot of different things depending 
on how you want to use Ceph, we prefer not to think of it as a binary 
term.
At this point we support the RADOS object store, radosgw, and RBD 
because we think they are sufficiently stable that we can handle the 
support workload. There are several organizations running those parts of
 the system in production. Others wouldn't dream of doing so at this 
stage.
The CephFS POSIX-compliant filesystem is functionally-complete and has 
been evaluated by a large community of users, but has not yet been 
subjected to extensive, methodical testing.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/faq/">Reference ceph FAQ</a></p>
<h3>II. Ceph installation</h3>
<p>Since there is no <em>stable</em> version, I decided to version with 
the upstream version of Ceph. Thus, I used the Ceph repository, I worked
 with the last version available so <code>0.47.2</code>:</p>
<PRE>
$ wget -q -O- https://raw.github.com/ceph/ceph/master/keys/release.asc | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo echo "deb http://ceph.newdream.net/debian precise main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph
</PRE>
<p>Since I don't have thousand nodes I decided to put every services on each node. 
Here my really basic Ceph configuration file:</p>
<pre><code>; Ceph conf file!
; use semi-colon to put a comment!
[global]
    auth supported = cephx
    keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring.admin
[mds]
    keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring.$name
[mds.0]
    host = server-03
[mds.1]
    host = server-04
[mds.2]
    host = server-06
[osd]
    osd data = /srv/ceph/osd$id
    osd journal = /srv/ceph/osd$id/journal
    osd journal size = 512
    osd class dir = /usr/lib/rados-classes
    keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring.$name
    ; working with ext4
    filestore xattr use omap = true
    ; solve rbd data corruption
    filestore fiemap = false
[osd.0]
    host = server-03
    devs = /dev/mapper/nova--volumes-lvol0
[osd.1]
    host = server-04
    devs = /dev/mapper/server-04-lvol0
[osd.2]
    host = server-06
    devs = /dev/sdb
[mon]
    mon data = /srv/ceph/mon$id
[mon.0]
    host = server-03
    mon addr = 172.17.1.4:6789
[mon.1]
    host = server-04
    mon addr = 172.17.1.5:6789
[mon.2]
    host = server-06
    mon addr = 172.17.1.7:6789
</code></pre>
<p>Generate the keyring authentication, deploy the configuration and 
configure the nodes. I will highly recommand to previously setup a SSH 
key authentication based because mkcephfs will attempt to connect via 
SSH to each servers (hostnames) you provided in the ceph configuration 
file. It can be a pain in the arse to enter the ssh password for every 
command run by mkcephfs!</p>
<p>Directory creation is not managed by the script so you have to create them 
manually on each server:</p>
<PRE>
server-03:~$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/ceph/{osd0,mon0}
server-04:~$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/ceph/{osd1,mon1}
server-06:~$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/ceph/{osd2,mon2}
</PRE>
<p>Don't forget to mount your OSD directory according to your disk map 
otherwise Ceph will by default use the root filesystem. It's up to you 
to use ext4 or XFS. For those of you who want to setup an ext4 cluster I
 extremly recommend to use the following mount options for your hard 
drive disks:</p>
<pre><code>user_xattr,rw,noexec,nodev,noatime,nodiratime,data=writeback,barrier=0
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the <code>mkcephfs</code> to deploy your cluster:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo mkcephfs -a -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf -k /etc/ceph/keyring.admin
</PRE>
<p>Ceph doesn't need root permission to execute his command, it simply 
needs to access the keyring. Each Ceph command you execute on the 
command line assumes that you are the <code>client.admin</code> default user. 
The <code>client.admin</code> key has been generated during the <code>mkcephfs</code>
 process. The interesting thing to know about cephx is that it's based 
on Kerberos ticket trust mecanism. If you want to go further with the 
cephx authentication check the 
<a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/config-cluster/authentication/?highlight=auth">ceph 
documentation</a> about it. Just make sure that your keyring is readable by 
<strong>everyone</strong>:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo chmod +r /etc/ceph/keyring.admin
</PRE>
<p>And launch all the daemons:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo service ceph start
</PRE>
<p>This will run every Ceph daemons, namely OSD, MON and MDS (<code>-a</code> flag), 
but you can specify a particular daemon with an extra parameter as <code>osd</code>, 
<code>mon</code> or <code>mds</code>. Now check the status of your cluster by running 
the following command:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph -k /etc/ceph/keyring.admin -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf health
HEALTH_OK
</PRE>
<p>As you can see I'm using the <code>-k</code> option, indeed Ceph 
supports cephx secure authentication between the nodes within the 
cluster, each connection and communication are initiated with this 
authentication mecanism. It depends on your setup but it can be overkill
 to use this system...</p>
<p>All the daemons are running (extract from the server-04):</p>
<PRE>
$ ps aux | grep ceph
root     22403  0.0  0.1 126204  7748 ?        Ssl  May23   0:35 /usr/bin/ceph-mon -i 1 --pid-file /var/run/ceph/mon.1.pid -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf

</PRE>
<p>Summarize of your ceph cluster status:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph -s

</PRE>
<p>You can also use the <code>-w</code> option to provide an endless and live output.</p>
<h4>II.2. Make it grow!</h4>
<p>It's really easy to expand your Ceph cluster. Here I will add a logical volume.</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph osd create
3
</PRE>
<p>Copy this into your <code>ceph.conf</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>[osd.3]
    host = server-03
    devs = /dev/mapper/nova--volumes-lvol0
</code></pre>
<p>Format, create the OSD directory, mount it:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/nova--volumes-lvol0
$ sudo mkdir /srv/ceph/osd3
$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/nova--volumes-lvol0 /srv/ceph/osd3
</PRE>
<p>Configure the authentifation, permission and grow the crunchmap:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph-osd -i 3 --mkfs --mkkey
$ ceph auth add osd.3 osd 'allow *' mon 'allow rwx' -i /etc/ceph/keyring.osd.3
$ sudo service ceph start osd.3
</PRE>
<p>At the moment, the OSD is part of the cluster but doesn't store any data, you 
need to add to the crush map:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph osd crush set 3 osd.3 1.0 pool=default host=server-03
</PRE>
<p>The migration starts, wait a few seconds and verify the space available with 
the <code>ceph -s</code> command, you should notice that your cluster is growing.</p>
<p>You can also perform this check and see that your storage tree has grown as well:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph osd tree
dumped osdmap tree epoch 43
# id  weight  type name   up/down reweight
-1    4   pool default
-3    4       rack unknownrack
-2    1           host server-03
0 1               osd.0   up  1   
-4    2           host server-04
1 1               osd.1   up  1   
3 1               osd.3   up  1   
-5    1           host server-06
2 1               osd.2   up  1
</PRE>
<p>I have 2 'resources' on the server-04 because I added a logical volume.</p>
<h4>II.3. Shrink your cluster</h4>
<p>It's remarkably simple to shrink your ceph cluster. First you need to 
<strong>stop your OSD daemon</strong> and <strong>wait</strong> until the OSD 
is marked as <strong>down</strong>.</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph osd crush remove osd.1
removed item id 1 name 'osd.1' from crush map
$ ceph osd rm 1
marked dne osd.1
$ sudo rm -r /srv/ceph/osd1/
</PRE>
<p>Remove this line from the <code>ceph.conf</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>[osd.1]
    host = server-03
</code></pre>
<p>When you work with OSD you will often see the <code>crushmap</code> term. But 
what is the crushmap?</p>
<p>CRUSH is a pseudo-random placement algorithm which tells where data 
(objects) should remain. The crush map contains these information.</p>
<h4>II.4. Re build an OSD from scratch</h4>
<p>Here I rebuilt the OSD number 1:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo service ceph stop osd
$ sudo umount /srv/ceph/osd1/
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/nova--volumes-lvol0
$ sudo tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback /dev/mapper/nova--volumes-lvol0
</PRE>
<p>Copy this in your <code>fstab</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/dev/mapper/nova--volumes-lvol0 /srv/ceph/osd1 ext4 rw,noexec,nodev,noatime,nodiratime,user_xattr,data=writeback,barrier=0 0 0
</code></pre>
<PRE>
$ sudo mount -a
$ ceph mon getmap -o /tmp/monmap
$ ceph-osd -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf --monmap /tmp/monmap -i 1 --mkfs
</PRE>
<p>Finally run the OSD daemon:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo service ceph start osd
</PRE>
<h4>II.5. Resize an OSD</h4>
<p>On an LVM based setup, stop the OSD server:</p>
<PRE>
$ mount | grep osd
/dev/mapper/server4-lvol0 on /srv/ceph/osd1 type ext4 (rw,noexec,nodev,noatime,nodiratime,user_xattr,data=writeback,barrier=0)
$ sudo service ceph stop osd1
$ sudo umount /srv/ceph/osd1
</PRE>
<p>Check your LVM status, here I resized my logical volume from 90G to 50G:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo lvs
  LV     VG      Attr   LSize  Origin Snap%  Move Log Copy%  Convert
  lvol0  server4 -wi-ao 50.00g
  root   server4 -wi-ao 40.00g
  swap_1 server4 -wi-ao  4.00g
$ sudo vgs
  VG      #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize   VFree 
  server4   1   3   0 wz--n- 135.73g 1.73 g
$ sudo e2fsck -f /dev/server4/lvol0
$ sudo lvresize /dev/server4/lvol0 -L 50G --resizefs
fsck from util-linux 2.20.1
e2fsck 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)
/dev/mapper/server4-lvol0: clean, 3754/2621440 files, 3140894/10485760 blocks
resize2fs 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)
Resizing the filesystem on /dev/dm-2 to 13107200 (4k) blocks.
The filesystem on /dev/dm-2 is now 13107200 blocks long.
  Reducing logical volume lvol0 to 50.00 GiB
  Logical volume lvol0 successfully resized
</PRE>
<p>Re-mount your device in the OSD directory and launch the OSD daemon:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo mount -a
$ sudo service ceph osd1 start
</PRE>
<p>Check the status <code>ceph -w</code>, you should noticed that the size changed 
and that everything is back to normal.</p>
<h4>II.6. Adjust the replication level</h4>
<p>The replication level is set to 2 by default, you can easily check this with 
the <code>size 2</code> value:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph osd dump | grep ^pool
pool 0 'data' rep size 2 crush_ruleset 0 object_hash rjenkins pg_num 192 pgp_num 192 last_change 1 owner 0 crash_replay_interval 45
pool 1 'metadata' rep size 2 crush_ruleset 1 object_hash rjenkins pg_num 192 pgp_num 192 last_change 1 owner 0
pool 2 'rbd' rep size 2 crush_ruleset 2 object_hash rjenkins pg_num 192 pgp_num 192 last_change 1 owner 0
pool 3 'nova' rep size 2 crush_ruleset 0 object_hash rjenkins pg_num 8 pgp_num 8 last_change 22 owner 0
pool 4 'images' rep size 2 crush_ruleset 0 object_hash rjenkins pg_num 8 pgp_num 8 last_change 10 owner 0
</PRE>
<p>Of course each pool might store more critical data, for instance my pool called 
<code>nova</code> store the RBD volume of each virtual machine, so I increased the 
replication level like this:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph osd pool set nova size 3
set pool 3 size to 3
</PRE>
<h4>II.7. Connect your client</h4>
<p>Clients can access the RADOS cluster either directly via <code>librados</code> 
with <code>rados</code> command. The usage of <code>librbd</code> is possible as 
well with the RBD tool (via <code>rbd</code>
 command), which creates an image / volume abstraction over the object 
store. To achieve highly available monitor, simply put all of them in 
the mount option:</p>
<PRE>
$ ceph-authtool --print-key /etc/ceph/keyring.admin
AQARB71PUCuuAxAAPhlUGzkRdDdjNDJy1w8MQQ==
client:~$ sudo mount -t ceph 172.17.1.4:6789,172.17.1.5:6789,172.17.1.7:6789:/ /mnt/ -vv -o \
  name=admin,secret=AQDVGc5P0LXzJhAA5C019tbdrgypFNXUpG2cqQ==
parsing options: rw,name=admin,secret=AQDVGc5P0LXzJhAA5C019tbdrgypFNXUpG2cqQ==
</PRE>
<p>Monitor reliability?</p>
<p>I tried to simulate a MON failure while CephFS is mounted. I stopped 
one of my MON server but precisely the one used for mounting CephFS. Oh 
yes.. I forgot to tell you I used only one monitor to mount Ceph... And 
the result was really unexpected, after I stopped the monitor the CephFS
 didn't crashed and stayed alive :). There is some <em>magic</em> 
performed under the hood by Ceph. I don't really know how but Ceph and 
monitors are clever enough to figure out MON failure and re-initiate a 
connection to an another monitor and thus keep the the mounting 
filesystem alive.</p>
<p>Check this:</p>
<PRE>
client:~$ mount | grep ceph
client:~$ sudo mount -t ceph 172.17.1.7:6789:/ /mnt -vv -o \
  name=admin,secret=AQDVGc5P0LXzJhAA5C019tbdrgypFNXUpG2cqQ==

<p>Impressive!</p>
<h3>III. Openstack integration</h3>
<h4>III.1. RDB and nova-volume</h4>
<p>Before starting, here is my setup, I voluntary installed nova-volume on a node of 
my Ceph cluster:</p>
<pre><code>   --- - ceph-node-01
      |
       - nova-volume
   --- - ceph-node-02
   --- - ceph-node-03
</code></pre>
<p>According to the OpenStack documentation on RBD I just added those lines in 
<code>nova.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>--volume_driver=nova.volume.driver.RBDDriver
--rbd_pool=nova
</code></pre>
<p>By default, the RBD pool named <code>rbd</code> will be use by OpenStack if 
nothing is specified. I prefered to use <code>nova</code> as a pool, so I created it:</p>
<PRE>
$ rados lspools
data
metadata
rbd
$ rados mkpool nova
$ rados lspools
data
metadata
rbd
nova
$ rbd --pool nova ls
volume-0000000c
$ rbd --pool nova info volume-0000000c
rbd image 'volume-0000000c':
  size 1024 MB in 256 objects
  order 22 (4096 KB objects)
  block_name_prefix: rb.0.0
  parent:  (pool -1)
</PRE>
<p>Restart your nova-volume:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo service nova-volume restart
</PRE>
<p>Try to create a volume, you shouldn't have any problem :)</p>
<PRE>
$ nova volume-create --display_name=rbd-vol 1
</PRE>
<p>Check this via:</p>
<PRE>
$ nova volume-list
+----+-----------+--------------+------+-------------+-------------+
| ID |   Status  | Display Name | Size | Volume Type | Attached to |
+----+-----------+--------------+------+-------------+-------------+

+----+-----------+--------------+------+-------------+-------------+
</PRE>
<p>Check in RBD:</p>
<PRE>
$ rbd --pool nova ls
volume-00000033
$ rbd --pool nova info volume-00000033
rbd image 'volume-00000033':
  size 1024 MB in 256 objects
  order 22 (4096 KB objects)
  block_name_prefix: rb.0.3
  parent:  (pool -1)
</PRE>
<p>Everything looks great, but wait.. can I attach it to an instance?</p>
<p>Since we are using cephx authentication, nova and libvirt require a couple 
more steps.</p>
<p>For security and clarity purpose you may want to create a new user and give 
it access to your Ceph cluster with fine permissions. Let's say that you want 
to use a user called <code>nova</code>, each connection to your MON server will 
be initiate as <code>client.nova</code> instead of <code>client.admin</code>.
This behavior is define by the <code>rados_create</code> function which create a 
handle for communicating with your RADOS cluster. Ceph environment variables are 
read when this is called, so if <code>$CEPH_ARGS</code> specifies everything you 
need to connect, no further configuration is necessary. The trick is to add the 
following lines at the beginning of 
the <code>/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/volume/driver.py</code> file:</p>
<PRE>
# use client.nova instead of nova.admin
import os
os.environ["CEPH_ARGS"] = "--id nova"
</PRE>
<p>Adding the variable via the init script of nova-volume should also 
work, it's up to you. The nova user needs this environment variable.</p>
<p>Here I assume that you use <code>client.admin</code>, if you use 
<code>client.nova</code> change every values called <code>admin</code> to 
<code>nova</code>. Now we can start to configure the secret in libvirt, create 
a file <code>secret.xml</code> and add this content:</p>
<PRE>
&lt;secret ephemeral='no' private='no'>
   &lt;usage type='ceph'>
     &lt;name>client.admin secret&lt;/name>
   &lt;/usage>
&lt;/secret>
</PRE>
<p>Import it into virsh:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo virsh secret-define --file secret.xml
Secret 83a0e970-a18b-5490-6fce-642f9052f976 created
</PRE>
<p>Virsh tells you the UUID of the secret, which is how you reference it for other 
libvirt commands. Now set this value with the <code>client.admin</code> key:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo virsh secret-set-value --secret 83a0e970-a18b-5490-6fce-642f9052f976 --base64 AQDVGc5P0LXzJhAA5C019tbdrgypFNXUpG2cqQ==
Secret value set
</PRE>
<p>At this point you should be able to attach a disk manually with virsh using 
this <code>disk.xml</code> file. I used the RBD volume previously created:</p>
<PRE>
&lt;disk type='network'>
  &lt;driver name="qemu" type="raw"/>
  &lt;source protocol="rbd" name="nova/volume-00000033">
    &lt;host name='172.17.1.4' port='6789'/>
    &lt;host name='172.17.1.5' port='6789'/>
    &lt;host name='172.17.1.7' port='6789'/>
  &lt;/source>
  &lt;target dev="vdb" bus="virtio"/>
  &lt;auth username='admin'>
    &lt;secret type='ceph' uuid='83a0e970-a18b-5490-6fce-642f9052f976'/>
  &lt;/auth>
&lt;/disk>
</PRE>
<p>Some explanations about this file:</p>

<p>Last but not least, edit your nova.conf on each nova-compute server 
with the authentication value. It's working without those options, since
 we added them manually to libvirt, but I think it good to tell them to 
nova. You will be able to attach a volume to an instance from the nova 
cli with <code>nova volume-attach</code> command and from the dashboard as well :D</p>

<p>The first disk is marked as <code>available</code> simply because it has been attached manually with virsh and not with nova. Have a look inside your virtual machine :)</p>

<p><strong>/!\ Important note, the secret.xml needs to be added on each

<p>Attaching error found:</p>
<pre><code>error : qemuMonitorJSONCheckError:318 : internal error unable to execute QEMU command 'device_add': Device 'virtio-blk-pci' could not be initialized 
error : qemuMonitorJSONCheckError:318 : internal error unable to execute QEMU command 'device_add': Duplicate ID 'virtio-disk2' for device 
</code></pre>
<p>The first one occured when I tried to mount a volume with <code>/dev/vdb</code> as device name and the second occured with <code>/dev/vdc</code>. Solved by using a different device name than <code>/dev/vdc/</code>,
 I think libvirt remembers 'somewhere' and 'somehow' that a device was 
previously attached (the manually one). I didn't really investigate 
since it can be simply solved.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: 11/07/2012</strong></p>
<p>Some people reported tp me a common issue. There were unable to 
attach a RBD device with nova, but with libvirt it's fine. If you have 
difficulties to make it working, you will probably need to update the 
libvirt AppArmor profile. If you check your <code>/var/log/libvirt/qemu/your_instance_id.log</code>, you should see:</p>
<pre><code>unable to find any monitors in conf. please specify monitors via -m monaddr or -c ceph.conf
</code></pre>
<p>And if you dive into the debug mode:</p>
<pre><code>debug : virJSONValueFromString:914 : string={"return": "error connecting\r\ncould not \
  open disk image rbd:nova/volume-00000050: No such file or directory\r\n", "id": "libvirt-12"}
</code></pre>
<p>And of course it's log in AppArmor and it's pretty explicit:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo grep -i denied /var/log/kern.log
server-01 kernel: [28874.202700] type=1400 audit(1341957073.795:51): apparmor="DENIED" 
  operation="open" parent=1 profile="libvirt-bd261aa7-728b-4edb-bd18-2ae2370b6549" 
  name="/etc/ceph/ceph.conf" pid=5833 comm="kvm" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" 
  fsuid=108 ouid=0
</PRE>
<p>Now edit the libvirt AppArmor profile, you need to adjust access controls for all 
VMs, new or existing:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo echo "/etc/ceph/** r," | sudo tee -a /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu
$ sudo service libvirt-bin restart
$ sudo service apparmor reload
</PRE>
<p>That's all, after this libvirt/qemu will be able to read your ceph.conf and your 
keyring (if you use cephx) ;-).</p>
<h4>III.2. RBD and Glance</h4>
<h5>III.2.1. RBD as Glance storage backend</h5>
<p>I followed the official instructions from <a href="http://glance.openstack.org/configuring.html">OpenStack documentation</a>.
 I recommend to follow the upstream package from Ceph since the Ubuntu 
repo doesn't provide a valid version. This issue has been recently 
reported by Florian Haas in the OpenStack and Ceph mailing list however 
the bug has already been tracked <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ceph/+bug/981130">here</a>.
 It has been uploaded to precise-proposed for SRU review and waiting for
 approval, this shouldn't be too long. Be sure to add the Ceph repo (<code>deb http://ceph.com/debian/ precise main</code>) on your Glance server (as I did earlier).</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo apt-get install python-ceph
</PRE>
<p>Modify your <code>glance-api.conf</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code># Set the rbd storage
default_store = rbd
# ============ RBD Store Options =============================
# Ceph configuration file path
# If using cephx authentication, this file should
# include a reference to the right keyring
# in a client.&lt;USER&gt; section
rbd_store_ceph_conf = /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
# RADOS user to authenticate as (only applicable if using cephx)
rbd_store_user = glance
# RADOS pool in which images are stored
rbd_store_pool = images
# Images will be chunked into objects of this size (in megabytes).
# For best performance, this should be a power of two
rbd_store_chunk_size = 8
</code></pre>
<p>According to the glance configuration, I created a new pool and a new user for RADOS:</p>
<PRE>
$ rados mkpool images
successfully created pool images
$ ceph-authtool --create-keyring /etc/glance/rbd.keyring
creating rbd.keyring
$ ceph-authtool --gen-key --name client.glance --cap mon 'allow r' --cap osd 'allow rwx pool=images' /etc/glance/rbd.keyring
$ ceph auth add client.glance -i /etc/glance/rbd.keyring
2012-05-24 10:45:58.101925 7f7097c31780 -1 read 122 bytes from /etc/glance/rbd.keyring
added key for client.glance
$ sudo chown glance:glance /etc/glance/rbd.keyring
</PRE>
<p>After this you should see a new key in ceph:</p>

<p>As you can see, it's stored in RBD: <code>rbd://cc7167d6-6dbe-4a2b-8609-b599a48ebbb6</code></p>
<p>From now, you should be able to launch new instance, Glance will retrieve image from the RBD pool.</p>
<h5>III.2.2. Instance snapshot to RBD</h5>
<p>Testing the snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>instance ad0e6a24-9648-406f-b86d-6312ea905888: snapshotting 
sudo nova-rootwrap qemu-img snapshot -c 56642cf3d09b49a7aa400b6bc07494b9 \
  /var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000097/disk 
qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 -s 56642cf3d09b49a7aa400b6bc07494b9 \
  /var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000097/disk /tmp/tmpt7EriB/56642cf3d09b49a7aa400b6bc07494b9
sudo nova-rootwrap qemu-img snapshot -d 56642cf3d09b49a7aa400b6bc07494b9 \
  /var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000097/disk
</code></pre>
<p>Let's describe the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first command initiates and create the snapshot with name 
<code>56642cf3d09b49a7aa400b6bc07494b9</code> from the image disk of the instance 
located here <code>/var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000097/disk</code>.</li>
<li>The second command will convert the image from qcow2 to qcow2 and 
store the backup into Glance thus in RBD. Here the image is stored as 
<code>qcow2</code> format, this is not really what we want! I want to store an RBD 
(format) image.</li>
<li>The third command deletes the local file of the snapshot, no longer 
needed since the image has been stored in the Glance backend.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you attempt to perform a snapshot of an instance from the dashboard or via the <code>nova image-create</code> command, nova executes a local copy of changes in a qcow2 file, however this file will be stored in Glance.</p>
<p>If you want to run a RBD snapshot through OpenStack, you need to take
 a volume snapshot. These functionnality is not exposed in the dashboard
 yet.</p>
<p>Snapshot a RBD volume:</p>
<pre><code>snapshot snapshot-00000004: creating 
snapshot snapshot-00000004: creating from (pid=18829) create_snapshot
rbd --pool nova snap create --snap snapshot-00000004 volume-00000042
snapshot snapshot-00000004: created successfully from (pid=18829) create_snapshot 
</code></pre>
<p>Verify:</p>
<PRE>
$ rbd --pool=nova snap ls volume-00000042
2 snapshot-00000004   1073741824

<p>Full RBD managment?</p>
<PRE>
$ qemu-img info precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
image: precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 2.0G (2147483648 bytes)
disk size: 217M
cluster_size: 65536
$ sudo qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O rbd precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.img rbd:images/glance
$ qemu-img info rbd:nova/ceph-img-cli
image: rbd:nova/ceph-img-cli
file format: raw
virtual size: 2.0G (2147483648 bytes)
disk size: unavailable
</PRE>
<p>There is a surprising value here, why does the image appear as <code>raw</code> format? And why does the file size become unavailable? For those of you, you want to go further with Qemu-RBD snapshot, <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/QEMU-RBD#Snapshotting">see the documentation from Ceph</a></p>
<h4>III.3. Does the dream come true?</h4>
<p>Boot from a RBD image?
I uploaded a new image in the glance RBD backend and try to boot with 
this image and it works. Glance is able to retrieve images over the RBD 
backend configured. You will usually see this log message:</p>
<pre><code>INFO nova.virt.libvirt.connection [-] [instance: ce230d11-ddf8-4298-a7d9-40ae8690ff11] Instance spawned successfully. 
</code></pre>
<h4>III.4. Boot from a volume</h4>
<p>Booting from a volume will require specifying a dummy image id, as shown in these scripts:</p>

<p>Both are a little bit deprecated so I re-wrote some parts, it's not 
that demanding. I barely spent much time on it, so there's still work to
 be done. For example, I don't use euca API, so I simply re-wrote 
according to nova-api.</p>
<p>Josh Durgin from Inktank said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>What's missing is that OpenStack doesn't yet have the 
ability to initialize a volume from an image. You have to put an image 
on one yourself before you can boot from it currently. This should be 
fixed in the next version of OpenStack. Booting off of RBD is nice 
because you can do live migration, although I haven't tested that with 
OpenStack, just with libvirt. For Folsom, we hope to have copy-on-write 
cloning of images as well, so you can store images in RBD with glance, 
and provision instances booting off cloned RBD volumes in very little 
time.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/auto-create-boot-volumes">It's already in the Folsom's roadmap</a></p>
<p>I quickly tried this manipulation, but without success:</p>

<h4>III.5. Live migration with CephFS!</h4>
<p>I was brave enough to also experimented the live migration with the 
Ceph Filesystem. Some of these pre-requites are obvious but just to be 
sure, with the live-migration comes mandatory requirements as:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 compute nodes</li>
<li>a distributed file system, here CephFS</li>
</ul>
<p>For the live-migration configuration I followed the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/admin/content/configuring-live-migrations.html">official OpenStack documentation</a>. The following actions need to be performed <strong>on each compute node</strong>:</p>
<p>Update the libvirt configurations. Modify <code>/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>listen_tls = 0
listen_tcp = 1
auth_tcp = "none"
</code></pre>
<p>Modify <code>/etc/init/libvirt-bin.conf</code> and add the <code>-l</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>libvirtd_opts=" -d -l"
</code></pre>
<p>Restart libvirt. After executing the command, ensure that libvirt is succesfully restarted.</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo stop libvirt-bin && sudo start libvirt-bin
$ ps -ef | grep libvirt
</PRE>
<p>Make sure that you see the <code>-l</code> flag in the <code>ps</code> command. You should be able to retrieve the information (passwordless) from an hypervisor to another, to test it simply run:</p>

<p>Sometimes you can get this message from the nova-scheduler logs:</p>
<pre><code>Casted 'live_migration' to compute 'server-01' from (pid=10963) cast_to_compute_host /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/scheduler/driver.py:80 
</code></pre>
<p>And somehow you <strong>must</strong> get something from the logs, so check:</p>
<ul>
<li>nova-compute logs</li>
<li>nova-scheduler logs</li>
<li>libvirt logs</li>
</ul>
<p>The libvirt logs could show those errors:</p>
<pre><code>error : virExecWithHook:328 : Cannot find 'pm-is-supported' in path: No such file or directory
error : virNetClientProgramDispatchError:174 : Unable to read from monitor: Connection reset by peer
</code></pre>
<p>The first issue (<code>pm</code>) was solved by installing this package:</p>
<PRE>
$ sudo apt-get install pm-utils -y
</PRE>
<p>The second one is a little bit more tricky, the only glue I found was to disable the VNC console according to <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg12389.html">this thread</a>.
Finally check the log and see:</p>
<pre><code>instance: 962c222f-2280-43e9-83be-c27a31f77946] Migrating instance to server-02 finished successfully. 
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes this message doesn't appear, but the live-migration 
successfully performed, the best check is to wait and watch on the 
distant server:</p>
<PRE>
$ watch sudo virsh list

</PRE>
<p>During the live migration, you should see those states in virsh:</p>
<ul>
<li>shut off</li>
<li>paused</li>
<li>running</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all!

<h4>III.6. Virtual instances disk's errors - Solved!</h4>
<p>When I use Ceph to store the <code>/var/lib/nova/instances</code> directory of each nova-compute server I have these I/O errors inside the virtual machines...</p>
<pre><code>Buffer I/O error on device vda1, logical block 593914

</code></pre>
<p>Logs from the kernel during the boot sequence of the instance:</p>
<pre><code>server-01 kernel: [  400.354943]  nbd15: p1
server-01 kernel: [  405.710253] EXT4-fs (dm-2): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)

server-01 kernel: [  410.400656] block nbd15: queue cleared
</code></pre>
<p>This issue appears everytime I launched a new instance. Sometimes 
waiting for the ext4 auto mecanism recovery solve temporary the problem 
but the filesystem still stays unstable. This error is probably due to 
the ext4 filesystem. It happens really often and I don't have any clue 
at the moment maybe a filesystem option or switching from ext4 to XFS 
will do the trick. At the moment I tried several mount options inside 
the VM like <code>nobarrier</code> or <code>noatime</code> but nothing changed. This is what I got when I tried to perform a basic operation like installing a package:</p>
<pre><code>Reading package lists... Error!
E: Unable to synchronize mmap - msync (5: Input/output error)
E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.
</code></pre>
<p>This can be solved by the following commands but it's neither useful nor relevant since this error will occur again and again...</p>

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install 'your_package'

<p>Nothing relevant, everything is properly working.</p>
<p><strong>This issue is unsolved, it's simply related to the fact that 
CephFS is not stable enough. It can't handle this amount of I/O. A 
possible work around, <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.ceph.devel/6557">here</a> and <a href="http://marc.info/?l=ceph-devel&amp;m=133758599712768&amp;w=2">here</a>.
 I don't even thing that using XFS instead of ext4 will change the 
outcome. It seems that this issue also occur with RBD volume, <a href="http://tracker.newdream.net/issues/2535">see on the ceph tracker</a>.</strong></p>
<p>According to this <a href="http://tracker.newdream.net/issues/2535">reported bug</a>
 (and the mailing list discussion) this issue affects rbd volumes inside
 virtual machine, the workaround here is to active the rbd caching, an 
option should be added inside the xml file while attaching a device.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;source protocol='rbd' name='your-pool/your-volume:rbd_cache=true'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't check this workaround yet, but it seems to be solved by enabling the cache.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: 13/06/2012 - I/O ISSUES SOLVED</strong></p>
<p>It seems that Ceph has a lot of difficulties with the direct I/O support, see below:</p>
<PRE>
$ mount | grep ceph
172.17.1.4:6789,172.17.1.5:6789,172.17.1.7:6789:/ on /mnt type ceph (name=admin,key=client.admin)

dd: writing `/mnt/directio': Bad address

</PRE>
<p>This bug has been tracked on the <a href="http://tracker.newdream.net/issues/2657">Ceph tracker</a></p>
<p>It seems that Ceph doesn't support the creation of blocks superior at
 9M. And? And if you check your libvirt of an instance you will see this
 section:</p>
<PRE>
&lt;disk type='file' device='disk'>
   &lt;driver type='qcow2' cache='none'/>
   &lt;source file='/var/lib/nova/instances/instance-000000f9/disk'/>
   &lt;target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>
&lt;/disk>
</PRE>
<p>Setting the cache to <code>none</code> means using direct I/O... Note from the libvirt documentation:</p>
<blockquote><p>The optional cache attribute controls the cache 
mechanism, possible values are "default", "none", "writethrough", 
"writeback", "directsync" (like "writethrough", but it bypasses the host
 page cache) and "unsafe" (host may cache all disk io, and sync requests
 from guest are ignored). Since 0.6.0, "directsync" since 0.9.5, 
"unsafe" since 0.9.7</p></blockquote>
<p>Cache parameters explained:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>none</strong>: uses O_DIRECT I/O that bypasses the filesystem cache on the host</li>
<li><strong>writethrough</strong>: uses O_SYNC I/O that is guaranteed to
 be commited to disk on return to userspace. Only cache read requests 
and immediately write to disk.</li>
<li><strong>writeback</strong>: uses normal buffered I/O that is written
 back later by the operating system. It caches the write requests in 
RAM, which bring high-performance but also increase the data loss 
probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually there is already a function to test if direct I/O are supported:</p>
<PRE>
@staticmethod
    def _supports_direct_io(dirpath):
        testfile = os.path.join(dirpath, ".directio.test")
        hasDirectIO = True
        try:
            f = os.open(testfile, os.O_CREAT | os.O_WRONLY | os.O_DIRECT)
            os.close(f)
            LOG.debug(_("Path '%(path)s' supports direct I/O") %
                      {'path': dirpath})
        except OSError, e:
            if e.errno == errno.EINVAL:
                LOG.debug(_("Path '%(path)s' does not support direct I/O: "
                            "'%(ex)s'") % {'path': dirpath, 'ex': str(e)})
                hasDirectIO = False
            else:
                LOG.error(_("Error on '%(path)s' while checking direct I/O: "
                            "'%(ex)s'") % {'path': dirpath, 'ex': str(e)})
                raise e
        except Exception, e:
            LOG.error(_("Error on '%(path)s' while checking direct I/O: "
                        "'%(ex)s'") % {'path': dirpath, 'ex': str(e)})
            raise e
        finally:
            try:
                os.unlink(testfile)
            except:
                pass
        return hasDirectIO
</PRE>
<p>Somehow it's not detected, mainly because the issue is related to the block size.</p>
<p>If direct I/O are supported it will specified in this file <code>/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/virt/libvirt/connection.py</code>, on line 1036:</p>
<PRE>
@property
def disk_cachemode(self):
    if self._disk_cachemode is None:
        # We prefer 'none' for consistent performance, host crash
        # safety & migration correctness by avoiding host page cache.
        # Some filesystems (eg GlusterFS via FUSE) don't support
        # O_DIRECT though. For those we fallback to 'writethrough'
        # which gives host crash safety, and is safe for migration
        # provided the filesystem is cache coherant (cluster filesystems
        # typically are, but things like NFS are not).
        self._disk_cachemode = "none"
        if not self._supports_direct_io(FLAGS.instances_path):
            self._disk_cachemode = "writethrough"
    return self._disk_cachemode
</PRE>
<p>The first trick was to modify this line:</p>
<pre><code>self._disk_cachemode = "none"
</code></pre>
<p>With</p>
<pre><code>self._disk_cachemode = "writethrough"
</code></pre>
<p>With this change, every instances will have the libvirt cache option set to <code>writethrough</code> even if the filesystem supports direct I/O.</p>
<p>Fix a corrumpted VM:</p>
<pre><code>FSCKFIX=yes
</code></pre>
<p>Reboot the VM :)</p>
<p>Note: <code>writeback</code> is also supported with Ceph, it offers better performance than <code>writethrough</code> but <code>writeback</code> stays the safest way for your data. It depends on your need :)</p>

<h4>Observations</h4>
<p>I hope I will be able to go further and use Ceph for production. Ceph
 seems fearly stable enough at the moment, for RBD and RADOS, CephFS 
doesn't seem capable to handle huge I/O traffic. Also keep in mind that a
 company called <a href="http://www.inktank.com/">Inktank</a> offers a 
commercial support for Ceph, I don't thing it's a coincidence. Ceph will
 have a bright future. The recovery procedure is excellent, of course 
there is a lot of component which I would loved to play like fine 
crushmap tunning. This article could be updated at any time since I'm 
taking my research further :).</p>
<p><strong>This article wouldn't have been possible without the tremendous help of Josh Durgin from <a href="http://www.inktank.com/">Inktank</a>, many many thanks to him :)</strong></p>

<a name="CephBenchmark"></a><h3>Ceph and RBD benchmarks <a href="http://learnitwithme.com/?p=303">(Source 
Origin)</a></h3>
<div class="date">
	Wednesday, August 24th, 2011</div>
<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/">Ceph</a>, 
an up and coming distributed&nbsp;file system, has a lot of great design
 goals. In short, it aims to distribute both data and metadata among 
multiple servers, providing both fault tolerant and scalable network 
storage.&nbsp;Needless to say, this has me excited, and while it's still
 under heavy development, I've been experimenting with it and thought 
I'd share a few simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>I've tested two different 'flavors' of Ceph, the first I believe is 
referred to as "Ceph filesystem", which is similar in function to NFS, 
where the file metadata (in addition to the file data) is handled by 
remote network services and the filesystem is mountable by multiple 
clients. The second is a "RADOS block device", or RBD. This refers to a 
virtual block device that is created from Ceph storage. This is similar 
in function to iSCSI, where remote storage is mapped into looking like a
 local SCSI device. This means that it's formatted&nbsp;and mounted 
locally and other clients can't use it without corruption (unless you 
format it with a cluster filesystem like GFS or OCFS).</p>
<p>If you're wondering what RADOS is, it's Ceph's acronym version of 
RAID. I believe it stands for "Reliable Autonomous Distributed Object 
Store". Technically, the Ceph filesystem is implemented on top of RADOS,
 and other things are capable of using it directly as well, such as the 
RADOS gateway, which is a proxy server that provides object store 
services like that of Amazon's S3. A librados library is also available 
that provides an API for customizing your own solutions.</p>
<p>I've taken the approach of comparing cephfs to nfs, and rbd to both 
iscsi and multiple iscsi devices striped over different servers. Mind 
you, Ceph provides many more features, such as snapshots and thin 
provisioning, not to mention the fault tolerance, but if we were to 
replace the function of NFS we'd put Ceph fs in its place; likewise if 
we replaced iSCSI, we'd use RBD. It's good to keep this in mind because 
of the penalties involved with having metadata at the server; we don't 
expect Ceph fs or NFS to have the metadata performance of a local 
filesystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ceph (version .032) systems were 3 servers running mds+mon services.
 These were quad core servers, 16G RAM. The storage was provided by 3 
osd servers (24 core AMD box, 32GB RAM, 28 available 2T disks, LSI 
9285-8e), each server used 10 disks, one osd daemon for each 2T disk, 
and an enterprise SSD partitioned up with 10 x 1GB journal devices. 
Tried both btrfs and xfs on the osd devices, for these tests there was 
no difference. CRUSH placement defined that no replica should be on the 
same host, 2 copies of data and 3 copies of metadata. All servers had 
gigabit NICs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second Ceph system has monitors, mds, and osd all on one box. This 
was intended to be a more direct comparison to the NFS server below, and
 used the same storage device served up by a single osd daemon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>NFS server was one of the above osd servers with a group of 12 2T drives in RAID50 formatted xfs and exported.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>RADOS benchmarks ran on the same two Ceph systems above, from which a 20T RBD device was created.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ISCSI server was tested with one of the above osd servers exporting a 12 disk RAID50 as a target.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ISCSI-md was achieved by having all three osd servers export a 12 disk RAID50 and the client striping across them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All filesystems were mounted noatime,nodiratime whether available or
 not. All servers were running kernel 3.1.0-rc1 on centos 
6.&nbsp;Benchmarks were performed using bonnie++, as well as a few 
simple real world tests such as copying data back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://learnitwithme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ceph-nfs-iscsi-benchmarks.ods">ceph-nfs-iscsi-benchmarks.ods</a></p>
<p>The sequential character writes were cpu bound on the client in all 
instances; the sequential block writes (and most sequential reads) were 
limited by the gigabit network. The Ceph fs systems seem to do well on 
seeks, but this did not translate directly into better performance in 
the create/read/delete tests. It seems that RBD is roughly in a position
 where it can replace iSCSI, but the Ceph fs performance needs some work
 (or at least some heavy tuning on my part) in order to get it up to 
speed.</p>
<p>It will take some digging to determine where the bottlenecks lie, but
 in my quick assessment most of the server resources were only 
moderately used, whether it be the monitors, mds, or osd devices. Even 
the fast journal SSD disk only ever hit 30% utilization, and didn't help
 boost performance significantly over the competitors who don't rely on 
it.</p>
<p>Still, there's something to be said for this, as Ceph allows storage 
to fail, be dynamically added, thin provisioned, rebalanced, snapshots, 
and much more, with passable performance, all in pre-1.0 code. &nbsp;I 
think Ceph has a big future in open source storage deployments, and I 
look forward to it being a mature product that we can leverage to 
provide dynamic, fault-tolerant network storage.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Rbd" title="Rbd">RBD</a> gives you a block device it should be possible to re-export this block device via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI" class="external text" rel="nofollow">iSCSI</a> just like you can re-export a <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Ceph" title="Ceph">Ceph</a> filesystem via <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Re-exporting_NFS" title="Re-exporting NFS">NFS</a>.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="iSCSI_Multipath_with_RBD">iSCSI Multipath with RBD</span></h4>
<p>iSCSI has some nice features like multipathing, with multipathing you
 can create multiple IP-paths to your SAN thus creating redundancy in 
your network. The one thing you have to make sure is that the data of 
the LUN's is synchronized somehow between the <i>targets</i> (server), since the <i>initiatior</i> (client) will <i>NOT</i> do this.
</p><p>Since <a href="http://ceph.com/w/index.php?title=RADOS&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="RADOS (page does not exist)">RADOS</a> in combination with the <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Rbd" title="Rbd">RADOS Block Driver</a> gives you this, you can create a High Available multipath iSCSI setup.
</p><p>A possible setup could look like:
</p><p><img alt="Iscsi rbd.jpg" src="http://ceph.com/w/images/4/45/Iscsi_rbd.jpg" 
height="556" width="350">
</p><p>Here you have two clients with:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://iscsitarget.sourceforge.net/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">iSCSI Enterprise Target</a>
</li><li> A kernel with the <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Rbd" title="Rbd">RADOS Block Driver</a>
</li></ul>
<p>The configuration on both hosts should be identical, which could be:
</p><p><i>/etc/ietd.conf</i>
</p>
<pre>Target iqn.2010-08.net.newdream.ceph:rados.iscsi.001
   Lun 0 Path=/dev/rbd0,Type=blockio,ScsiId=f817ab
   Lun 1 Path=/dev/rbd1,Type=blockio,ScsiId=ah194l
   Lun 2 Path=/dev/rbd2,Type=blockio,ScsiId=dj291k</pre>
<p>Now, both <i>targets</i> should have this configuration and have <i>/dev/rbd0</i>, <i>/dev/rbd1</i>, <i>/dev/rbd2</i> configured via the <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Rbd" title="Rbd">RADOS Block Driver</a> interface.
</p><p>We choose <i>Type=blockio</i> since we want <i>Direct Block I/O</i>, should we choose <i>fileio</i>, the kernel on the <i>target</i> will utilize it's file cache, which will then lead to cache-inconsistency between the <i>targets</i>. Choosing <i>blockio</i> will by-pass the kernel's cache, which is good in this case.
</p><p>Switching to <i>fileio</i> could give you a performance boost, but then you will have to switch to a single <i>target</i> setup, but then you will loose the redundancy.
</p><p>For a <a href="#MultiPathIscsi">Multipath iSCSI setup</a> you will need to specify a <i>ScsiId</i> for each lun, this enables <i>dm-multipath</i> on the <i>initiator</i> to find out which SCSI devices are the same and map them to one logical SCSI device.
</p><p>When this is up and running you should be able to do a discovery 
(send targets) on both targets and get your multipath setup running.
</p><p>Since iSCSI is supported on Linux, Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD and 
many other platforms, it's a easy and reliable way to get data from your
 <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Ceph" title="Ceph">Ceph</a> cluster shared with other platforms.
</p><p>Someday there might be a driver for Windows or FreeBSD, but there
 will always be situations (for example with SLA's) where you don't want
 third-party drivers in your setup.

<h3>Multipath iSCSI under Linux
<a href="http://blog.widodh.nl/2009/11/multipath-iscsi-under-linux/">(Source 
Origin)</a></h3>
<p>Building a iSCSI Target (Server) under Linux is fairly simple, 
just install Enterprise iSCSI Target (IET) and you are ready. The 
Initiator (Client) is simple to, just use Open-iSCSI and you are ready 
to go, but how do you make this redundant?</p>
<p>When i first started using iSCSI i heard about the term "multipath", i
 read that you could make a redundant IP link to your iSCSI Target with 
multipath, but how?</p>
<p>Searching on the web didn't give me real practical anwsers. After 
using multipath for about 2 years now, i thought, why don't i make a 
blog post about it so other people can have redundant iSCSI to!</p>
<p>For this example i have a iSCSI Target with two IP's:</p>
<ol>
<li>172.16.0.1/255.255.255.0</li>
<li>172.16.1.1/255.255.255.0</li>
</ol>
<p>These IP's given to eth0 and eth1, via two switches the connectivity is given to my initiator with the IP's:</p>
<ol>
<li>172.16.0.101/255.255.255.0</li>
<li>172.16.1.101/255.255.255.0</li>
</ol>
<p>So there is a redundant network connection to the target, now we just have to start using this.</p>
<p>My target has as IQN: "iqn.2009-11-11.widodh.storage:iscsi-001"</p>
<p>I suppose you know how to configure IET and Open-iSCSI, so i'll just 
skip the regular configuration. In this example my Target exports one 
LUN of 10GB.</p>
<p>On the client (Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty)) you have to install:</p>
<ol>
<li>open-iscsi</li>
<li>multipath-tools</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's it, there is no configuration needed for multipath, this is all done dynamically.</p>
<p>Now we are going to discover the Target on both IP's and log on to it:</p>
<pre>iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p 172.16.1.1
iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p 172.16.0.1
iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.2009-11-11.widodh.storage:iscsi-001 -p 172.16.0.1 --login
iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.2009-11-11.widodh.storage:iscsi-001 -p 172.16.1.1 --login</pre>
<p>The nicest thing about this is, that Multipath itself discovers that 
there is a redundant connection to a SCSI device and everything is done 
for you.</p>
<p>In "/dev/mapper" you'll find (for example) "14945540000000000000000000100000099b2f8000f000000"and that is your multipath device.</p>
<p>You can list your multipath devices with:</p>
<pre>multipath -ll</pre>
<p>In my example this looked like:</p>
<pre>14945540000000000000000000100000099b2f8000f000000dm-0 IET     ,VIRTUAL-DISK  
[size=35G][features=0][hwhandler=0]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=1][active]
 \_ 4:0:0:0 sdd 8:48  [active][ready]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=1][enabled]
 \_ 3:0:0:0 sdc 8:32  [active][ready]</pre>
<p>Multipath detected a redundant path for "sdc" and "sdd" and created a device which i could use.</p>
<p>If one of the connections goes down for what ever reason, you should see this in your dmesg:</p>
<pre>[ 2070.285310] device-mapper: multipath: Failing path 8:32.</pre>
<p>Multipath will then show:</p>
<pre>sdc: checker msg is "directio checker reports path is down"
14945540000000000000000000100000099b2f8000f000000dm-0 IET     ,VIRTUAL-DISK  
[size=35G][features=0][hwhandler=0]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=1][active]
 \_ 4:0:0:0 sdd 8:48  [active][ready]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=0][enabled]
 \_ 3:0:0:0 sdc 8:32  [failed][faulty]</pre>
<p>Yes, you will see a lot of SCSI errors in your dmesg, but since you have a redundant path that is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind, use 
"/dev/mapper/14945540000000000000000000100000099b2f8000f000000" as your 
block device for whatever you intent to use it!</p>
<p>Multipath in combination with iSCSI is really great, a simple network
 hickup will never get your services down and you can keep your network 
like a basic Layer-2 network, no STP is needed, the redundant paths can 
go over fully seperated links which decreases the chance for downtime!</p>
<p>Have fun using multipath!</p>
