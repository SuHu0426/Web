<h2>Creating UML Root File System and MLN template</h2> 
 
    <a href="http://140.120.7.20/uml-rfs/README.html#MLNTemplate"  
    target="newwindow">Create Our own DebianNet Template for MLN</a> 
<h2>Finally, got it worked</h2> 
 
  <p> The following procedures will create an UML mimicking your host.  It is not  
     suitable for UML Servers, (such as: UML Dns, http, IP, mail, servers, etc,)  
     deployment.  (They need much less system resource.)  It is only good for High  
     Availability Cluster Management! 
 
<h3>On the host side</h3> 
<OL> 
  <LI><a href="#PUML" target="newwindow">Preparation for UML</a> 
 
  <LI><a href="#DebSqz" target="newwindow">UMLrf For Debian/Squeeze</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <a href="#CRFUML" target="newwindow">Creating Root File System for UML</a> 

<P> The second anchor is a reference for creating UML Root Filesystem for Ubuntu, 
   a rather bad choice.  This is a mistake I made before. I keep it here for 
   historical reason.  Nowadays, We base our UML (user mode linux) virtualization 
   on Debian, a much wiser choice!
 
  <LI>X window support on the host side: 
 
   <P>If user mode linux is going to provide X window capability, make sure host can  
      provide it from remote login. Login the host from a remote host via ssh command.  
      After seeing the login prompt, login and run the xterm command in it: 
<PRE> 
$ xterm& 
</PRE> 
 
      <p> If xterm window shows up, type "exit" in the new xterm window.  You are sure  
          your uml will be able to provide X window services. 
 
      <p><b>Note:</b> First line  
         <code>"127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost"</code> in  
         <code>/etc/hosts</code> should not be deleted. 
 
 
       <p>Also, the suffix string "-nolisten tcp" in file  
       <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc</code> prevents all remote machines from  
       getting X window support.  It seems that the uml will not be able to share  
       X window from host because of it!

<h3>Duplicate UMLs</h3> 
 
<P> We can duplicate more UMLs after the first one is running smoothly: 
<OL> 
  <LI> Shut down the running UML. 
 
  <LI> Copy its root file system to a new one. 
 
  <LI> Run <b>Config-UML-Rfs</b> with 4 or 5 arguments: 
 
<PRE> 
$ Config-UML-Rfs root-fs-pathname hostname UML-IP Eth-Card [TAP-No] 
#    Argument 5 is optional, if need tap to be different from tap0. 
$ Config-UML-Rfs /src3/UML/uml-rfs-new test1 192.168.0.232 eth2 1 
# $ ln Config-UML-Rfs Config-UML-Rfs-UmlSwitch 
# When script is invoked by Config-UML-Rfs-UmlSwitch, it writes script using uml_switch. 
# Otherwise, it writes script using vde_switch, with syntax more close to kvm script. 
# Do we get any benefit?  I honestly don't know! 
</PRE> 
 
  <P>  Frequently, we have several ether cards in our host machine, especially if our  
  built-in Eather Cards were not supported by Linux.  We can get the HostIp from our 
  main ether card, i.e. the one we get connected to the Internet.  The <b>Eth-Card</b> 
  parameter must be this one which connects us to the Internet.

<h3>Unresolved Questions (Resolved!!)</h3> 
 
<OL> 
  <LI> With super user id, update software packages as follow: 
 
<PRE> 
 # apt-get update 
 # apt-get upgrade 
</PRE> 
 
  <LI> Software Packages Update: 
 
      <P> Can we use synaptic to update software packages? Doing it remotely is not  
     possible, X11 connection rejected.  This is understandable and we offer almost  
     no protection on virtual machines, if synaptic can be used to update software  
     packages, it should be done on UML console.  And after populating file system,  
     we have upgraded it once via: <code>apt-get dselect-upgrade</code> 
  <LI> Should host <code>/usr/lib</code> be mounted on UML? 
 
      <P> No, I believe!  Since the software packages may use shared object files  
     in the <code>/usr/lib</code> directory.  If we have not upgraded our software  
     in time, if some command, such as firefox, still use old libraries, we will  
     be in trouble!  Recently, firefox has been upgraded in host.  In UML, we are  
     not able to invoke it anymore. 
 
      <P> Shut av-05 down, and bring it up again without the <code>/usr/lib</code>  
     directory mounted, can firefox be invoked again?  This is a nice test case!! 
 
      <P> Case in point, host ac04 and ac05 have <code>/usr/bin/gcin</code> which  
     is needed by firefoxes in the host machines.  But in UML-root-fs, firefox  
     package installation does not install it.  When running firefox in UML av-04,  
     av-05, we are running it according to <code>/usr/lib/firefox</code> in the  
     <b>host</b> machines, not the UML <code>/usr/lib/firefox</code> anymore. 
     When mounting uml-root-fs on /mnt/tmp, these two directories are quite  
     different!

<h3>Preventing Brute Force Attack on sshd</h3> 
 
  <P> After deployment of UML, Brute Force Attacks on ssh are coming continuously, 
mostly from Mainland China.  We need to install and configure <code>fail2ban</code> 
package.  Ubuntu <code>fail2ban 0.8.2-2</code> package has a bug in it.  Must load  
it from Debian <code>fail2ban 0.8.2-3</code>.

  <h2>Preventing Brute Force Attacks With Fail2ban On Debian Etch </h2> 
<p>Version 1.0<br> 
  Author: Falko Timme &lt;ft [at] falkotimme [dot] com&gt; <br> 
Last edited 04/24/2007</p> 
<p>In this article I will show how to install and configure <a mce_real_href="http://www.fail2ban.org" href="http://www.fail2ban.org/" target="_blank">fail2ban</a> 
on a Debian Etch system. Fail2ban is a tool that observes login 
attempts to various services, e.g. SSH, FTP, SMTP, Apache, etc., and if 
it finds failed login attempts again and again from the same IP address 
or host, fail2ban stops further login attempts from that IP 
address/host by blocking it with an iptables firewall rule.</p> 
 
<h3>Preliminary Note</h3> 
<p> Fail2ban is similar to <a mce_real_href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/"  
href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">DenyHosts</a> which I  
covered in this tutorial:  
<a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/preventing_ssh_dictionary_attacks_with_denyhosts"  
target="newwindow">Preventing Ssh Dictionary Attacks With Denyhosts</a>, 
but unlike DenyHosts which focuses on SSH, fail2ban can be configured 
to monitor any service that writes login attempts to a log file, and 
instead of using <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code> to block IP  
addresses/hosts, fail2ban uses iptables.</p> 
<p>In this example I will configure fail2ban to monitor login attempts 
to the SSH server, the Proftpd server, login attempts to 
.htaccess/.htpasswd protected web sites, to Courier POP3 and Courier 
IMAP, and to SASL (for sending emails). I will install the fail2ban 
package that is available for Debian Etch. It comes with a default 
configuration, but unfortunately that configuration doesn't quite work 
for most of the aforementioned services. Therefore I will create a 
customized fail2ban configuration that I have tested and that works for 
me. </p> 
 
<h3>Installing fail2ban</h3> 
<p>Fail2ban can be installed as follows on Debian Etch:</p> 
<p class="command">apt-get install fail2ban</p> 
<p>Afterwards, you will find all fail2ban configuration files in the  
<code>/etc/fail2ban</code> directory.  </p> 
 
<h3>Configuring fail2ban</h3> 
<p>The default behaviour of fail2ban is configured in the file  
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>. Take a look at it, it's not hard to  
understand. There's a <span class="system">[DEFAULT]</span> section that  
applies to all other sections unless the default options are overriden in  
the other sections. </p> 
<p>I explain some of the configuration options here:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li><span class="system">ignoreip</span>: This is a 
space-separated list of IP addresses that cannot be blocked by 
fail2ban. For example, if the computer from which you're connecting to 
the server has a static IP address, you might want to list it here.</li> 
  <li><span class="system">bantime</span>: Time in seconds that a host is  
blocked if it was caught by fail2ban (600 seconds = 10 minutes).</li> 
  <li><span class="system">maxretry</span>: Max. number of failed login  
attempts before a host is blocked by fail2ban.</li> 
  <li><span class="system">filter</span>: Refers to the appropriate filter  
file in <span class="system">/etc/fail2ban/filter.d</code>.</li> 
  <li><span class="system">logpath</span>: The log file that fail2ban checks  
for failed login attempts.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>As suggested by a comment at the top of <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>,  
we don't modify <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code> itself to adjust it to our  
needs, but override it by creating a new configuration file,  
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local</code>.</p> 
<p>This is what my <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local</code> file looks like:</p> 
<p class="command">vi /etc/fail2ban/jail.local</p>

<p>My client computer has the static IP address <code>192.168.0.99</code>, and  
because I don't want to be locked out, I've added it to the  
<span class="system">ignoreip</span> list. I've set the max. number of failed  
login attempts to 5 for all services, and I've created two new sections,  
<span class="system"> [courierpop3]</span> and  
<span class="system">[courierimap]</span>, so that fail2ban can block login  
attempts to my Courier-POP3 and Courier-IMAP server. </p> 
<p>I want to control login attempts to ssh, apache, proftpd, courierpop3,  
courierimap, and sasl, so I've set <span class="system">enabled</span> to  
<span class="system">true</span> for these services and to  
<span class="system">false</span> for all other services. </p> 
<p>If you compare the file with <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>,  
you'll also notice that I've changed some log files because the log files in  
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code> are not correct for Debian Etch. In addition  
to that, I've added a <span class="system">failregex</span> line to some services  
because the regular expressions in the appropriate filter files in the  
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d</code> directory do not work for Debian Etch.  
The <span class="system">failregex</span> line overrides the filter rule in the  
appropriate file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d</code>.</p> 
<p>Whenever we modify the fail2ban configuration, we must restart fail2ban, so  
this is what we do now:</p> 
<p class="command">/etc/init.d/fail2ban restart</p> 
<p>That's it already. Fail2ban logs to <code>/var/log/fail2ban.log</code>, so you  
can check that file to find out if/what hosts got blocked. If a host got blocked  
by fail2ban, it looks like this:</p> 
<p class="system">2007-04-24 17:49:09,466 fail2ban.actions: WARNING [apache]  
Ban 1.2.3.4<br> 
  2007-04-24 18:08:33,213 fail2ban.actions: WARNING [sasl] Ban 1.2.3.4<br> 
  2007-04-24 18:26:37,769 fail2ban.actions: WARNING [courierlogin] Ban 1.2.3.4<br> 
2007-04-24 18:39:06,765 fail2ban.actions: WARNING [courierimap] Ban 1.2.3.4 </p> 
<p>You can also check your firewall to see if any hosts are currently blocked. Simply  
run</p> 
<p class="command">iptables -L  </p>

Before we begin we will need to download the kernel source tree.  There are  
several mirrors that have the kernel source code available for download.  For  
this tutorial we are going with the <span class="emphasis"><em>2.6.15.1</em></span> version of  
the Linux kernel. 
</p><div class="example"><a name="id2450102"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 1. Downloading the Kernel</b></p><pre class="screen">		<code class="prompt">#</code>wget http://mirror.clarkson.edu/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.15.1.tar.bz2 
		Alternatevely <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/" target="_top">www.kernel.org</a> 
	</pre></div><p> 
If you download a version of the kernel that is earlier than 2.6.9 you will  
also need to download a seperate patch for the uml architecture. 
</p><p> 
At this point we can now extract the kernel source code.  In this example we  
will be extracting it in the current user's home directory.   
</p><div class="example"><a name="id2450143"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 2. Unpacking the package</b></p><pre class="screen">		<code class="prompt">#</code>cd ~/

</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="configure"></a>Configure</h3></div></div></div><p> 
We are now ready to configure our kernel for building it.  There are many  
different kernel options that you will need to select in order to build a  
fully functional kernel.  We will also turn on kernel debugging support and  
debug symbols.  The following command will launch the kernel configuration  
program <span class="emphasis"><em>menuconfig</em></span> 
</p><div class="example"><a name="id2450196"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3. Kernel Configuration</b></p><pre class="screen">	<code class="prompt">#</code>cd linux-2.6.15.1

      </div> 
   
<p> 
In my May 2006 Paranoid Penguin column, I expounded on the virtues of Debian 3.1's excellent 
support for virtualization environments, including User-Mode Linux.  In 
that same issue, in the article "User-Mode Linux", 
Matthew Hoskins gave a quick-and-dirty recipe for test-driving User-Mode 
Linux using prebuilt UML kernels and root filesystem images. 
</p><p> 
Did those articles whet your appetite for a more comprehensive and security-focused 
look at using UML? If so, you're in luck; for the next couple of columns, we're 
going to dive into the User-Mode Linux experience and cover every step 
(including every command) for creating your very 
own User-Mode Linux containers for network services. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb44dd8"></a> 
Objectives</div><p> 
So, why are we doing this, and what do we hope to achieve? As I've said 
before in this space, virtualization is similar to the concept of the 
chroot (changed root) jail.  It encapsulates a process or dæmon into a 
subset of the operating environment in which it resides, in a manner that 
makes it much harder for attackers to get at the underlying environment 
should they succeed in compromising that process or dæmon. 
</p><p> 
Whereas chrooting restricts a process to a subset of the host system's real 
filesystem, virtualization restricts the process to a complete virtual 
machine running within the host (real) machine.  This includes a completely 
virtualized hard disk, memory and kernel, and even virtualized system 
devices, such as network and sound cards.  In the case of User-Mode Linux, 
this is achieved by running a guest (virtual) kernel as a user-space 
process within the host (real) kernel. 
</p><p> 
Because both guest and host kernel are Linux kernels, virtualization 
in User-Mode Linux is fast and efficient.  And, because the guest kernel does 
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to run as root under the host kernel, even 
attackers who 
compromise some dæmon on the guest system <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> 
escalate their 
privileges to root (on the guest system) <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> somehow manage to 
gain shell access to the underlying host system will have achieved 
only unprivileged access to that host system. 
</p><p> 
This does not make it impossible to gain root access to the host system. 
If attackers do make it as far as shell access on the host, they 
may be able to escalate their privileges via some local privilege 
escalation vulnerability in the host's kernel or some user-space 
program on the host.  (Remember: no vulnerability is strictly local 
on <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> networked system!) It 
<span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> mean, however, that it's 
more difficult for attackers to get to the point of being able to exploit 
such a vulnerability, especially if it isn't also present on the guest 
(virtual) system. 
</p><p> 
This brings us to our design goals.  The guest machine should be 
as bare-bones as possible with respect to installed software--both 
to minimize resource utilization and to minimize its potential for 
compromise (its attack surface).  If, for example, the guest machine 
is to act as a DNS server, it should have basic network support, BIND 
(or some other DNS server package) and very little else.  No X Window 
System and no Apache--nothing else not directly related to DNS services. 
</p><p> 
If you're really paranoid, you even can skip the Secure Shell dæmon 
and instead administer the system via a virtual serial console.  (Though 
allowing SSH from only authorized IP addresses, such as that of 
the host system, might be a more reasonable middle ground.) You could 
also run User-Mode Linux under SELinux; however, that's beyond the scope 
of this series of articles. 
</p><p> 
If a single bastion server is to host multiple network services--for 
example, Apache and BIND--you could run two different guest systems on 
the same host: one containing only Apache and its dependent packages 
and another containing only BIND et al.  In this way, a vulnerability in 
BIND would not lead directly to Web site defacement.  Conversely, a poorly 
coded Web application would not necessarily lead to DNS tampering. 
</p><p> 
In summary, our two design principles will be to run one virtual 
machine per major network service and to make each virtual machine 
as minimal and secure as possible.  The end result will (hopefully) be 
a very compartmentalized bastion server that places as much defensive 
abstraction as possible between attackers and total root compromise. 
</p><p> 
For the remainder of this series of articles, I use the example of 
a single guest system running BIND.  Both guest and host system are 
based on Debian 3.1, because Debian is so popular for UML guests (it 
lends itself to stripped-down installations--a trait it shares with 
Slackware).  However, most of what follows also applies to other Linux 
distributions on both host and guest. 
</p><p> 
Our tasks are: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p> 
Build a host kernel optimized for hosting User-Mode Linux guests. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Build one or more guest kernels to run on top of the host. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Obtain and customize a prebuilt root filesystem for our guests. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Run, configure and harden our guest system for secure DNS services. 
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb456c8"></a> 
Preparing the Host</div><p> 
First, you need to make sure you've got the right kind 
of kernel on your host system.  You very likely may need 
to compile a new kernel. 
</p><p> 
On the one hand, some Linux distributions already have User-Mode Linux 
compiled into their default kernels.  On the other hand, your distribution 
of choice may or may not also have the skas (separate kernel address 
space) patch compiled in as well.  It is, in fact, somewhat unlikely that 
your default kernel has skas support.  Although the Linux kernel source 
code has included UML support since version 2.6.9, the skas patch is still 
maintained separately (and Linus has resisted its inclusion). 
</p><p> 
The skas patch is important.  It greatly improves UML performance 
and security by running the guest system's kernel in separate 
address space from its other processes (just like the host's 
kernel does).  The User-Mode Linux Web site's skas page on SourceForge 
provides a more detailed 
explanation of why you need skas (see the on-line Resources). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb45880"></a></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b> 
Keeping Your Kernels and Guests Straight</b></p><p> 
In the contexts of User-Mode Linux, VMware and other virtualization 
systems, we use the words host and guest in a very specific way.  Your 
host is the system that runs the virtualization environment--that 
is, it acts as a host to one or more virtual machines.  Guests 
are virtual machine instances that live on top of the host. 
</p><p> 
Therefore, when we speak of the host kernel and guest kernels, 
remember that guest kernels run on top of the host kernel.  In 
User-Mode Linux, your host kernel is a normal Linux kernel, compiled 
for your particular hardware platform (Intel x86, IBM PowerPC and so on), 
with User-Mode Linux features (including the optional skas patch) 
compiled in as well. 
</p><p> 
Your guest kernel, on the other hand, must be compiled to run on virtual 
hardware: the um architecture.  Other than that, it does 
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> 
need the skas patch or User-Mode Linux support enabled.  Unless, that is, 
you want to run other guest kernels on top of it.  Running guests 
within guests is possible (this is called nesting), but well beyond 
the scope of this article. 
</p><p> 
Each UML virtual machine instance consists of a guest kernel, a guest root 
filesystem and a COW (Copy On Write) file.  The root filesystem is a disk 
image file; it contains every file in your virtual machine except the 
kernel itself.  When you execute a guest kernel, the root filesystem file 
is mounted in precisely the same way you'd mount any other disk image, 
for example, a CD ISO file.  Like a CD-ROM, it's used in read-only mode. 
Any changes you make to the virtual filesystem in the course of a UML 
session, including new files and file deletions, are stored in a COW file. 
</p><p> 
Thanks to the magic of COWs, it's therefore possible to run the same 
guest kernel and root filesystem combination multiple times, by defining 
a unique COW file per instance. 
</p></div><p> 
To obtain kernel source code, your best bet may be simply to install your 
Linux distribution's kernel-source package.  Take care, however, that your 
distribution provides a kernel version of 2.6.9 or higher, because 
UML support is included from 2.6.9 onward, 
and prior UML patches had security vulnerabilities. 
</p><p> 
Because Debian 3.1 still uses kernel version 2.6.8, I decided not to use 
the official Debian kernel packages and instead downloaded the 2.6.17 
kernel from kernel.org.  I did, however, install the kernel-package 
package, which provides tools for generating Debian packages from official 
kernel source. 
</p><p> 
Besides kernel source code, you need the skas patch, the 
latest version of which is available on Blaisorblade's site (see Resources).  Be sure to download the 
patch version that corresponds to the kernel source code you're about 
to patch. 
</p><p> 
On my Debian host, I unpacked my official source code to 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3, renamed the source code directory to 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host and copied the skas patch tarball 
(skas-2.6.17-rc5-v9-pre9.patch.bz2) to /usr/src. I then changed 
ownership 
of the directory /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host to a nonroot account. 
(Adhering to the principle of never being root unless you really need 
to, 
we're going to do most of this kernel build as an unprivileged user.) 
</p><p> 
Here are the commands I executed as root: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">host:/usr/src/# tar -xjvf ./linux-2.6.17.3.tar.bz 
host:/usr/src/# mv ./linux-2.6.17.3 ./linux-2.6.17.3-host 
host:/usr/src/# chown mick ./linux-2.6.17.3 
host:/usr/src/# su - mick 
</pre> 
<p> 
To apply the skas patch, I then navigated, as my nonroot user, to 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host and ran the following command: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host$ bunzip2 -c 
 ../skas-2.6.17-rc5-v9 -pre9.patch.bz2 | patch -p1 
</pre> 
<p> 
Next, from the same directory, I issued the command <tt>make 
menuconfig</tt>.  When 
setting up the kernel configuration for User-Mode Linux, the defaults 
generally are fine, though you should ensure that the 
configuration matches your host's hardware.  In addition, it's probably 
prudent to double-check the following settings: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> 
Under Processor type and features, make sure /proc/mm is enabled. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Under Networking options, make sure IP: tunneling and 802.1d Ethernet 
Bridging are enabled.  If you intend to restrict guest system behavior 
with iptables, you also may want to check the Network packet filtering 
section to ensure that Core Netfilter Configuration, IP: Netfilter 
Configuration and Bridged IP/ARP packets filtering are set up. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Under Network device support, enable Universal TUN/TAP 
device driver support. 
</p></li><li><p> 
And, by all means, make sure to hard-compile (into the kernel, not as 
a module) the filesystem in which your system's root partition is formatted 
(for example, ext3 or ReiserFS). 
</p></li></ul></div><p> 
From this point on, the process is the same with any other kernel 
build: issue the commands <tt>make bzImage</tt> and 
<tt>make modules;</tt>.  Then, become 
root and issue the commands <tt>make modules</tt>, 
<tt>make modules_install</tt> and 
<tt>make install</tt>.  (Or in the case of Debian, use the 
<tt>make-kpkg</tt> command 
to achieve the same thing, and run <tt>dpkg</tt> to install the resulting kernel 
package.) 
</p><p> 
Once your new host kernel is installed, reboot your system.  Your host 
system is now capable of running User-Mode Linux guest systems. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb3cf38"></a> 
Creating a Guest Kernel</div><p> 
Okay, we've got UML host capabilities, but we still need a guest kernel 
to run.  This process is somewhat simpler than the host-kernel build, 
because we don't need the skas patch. 
</p><p> 
First, navigate back to the directory in which your Linux kernel-source 
tarball resides, and unpack it a second time.  Remember when we renamed the 
unzipped source code directory? This was so we could unpack the kernel 
tarball a second time.  We need to build our host and guest kernels in 
separate source trees. 
</p><p> 
On my Debian test system, therefore, I unpacked the source 
tarball to /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3, and this time, renamed it to 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest.  Again, change ownership of this directory 
to a nonprivileged user, and change your working directory to it. 
</p><p> 
Again, at this point we can skip the step of applying the skas 
patch.  Because we're going to compile our kernel for the special um 
(User-Mode Linux) architecture rather than for a real architecture like 
x86, I recommend you prepare your source code tree with the following 
three commands: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make mrproper ARCH=um 
host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make defconfig ARCH=um 
host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make menuconfig ARCH=um 
</pre> 
<p> 
The <tt>make mrproper</tt> command clears out any configuration and object 
files in your source tree; <tt>make defconfig</tt> generates a fresh default 
configuration file appropriate to the um architecture; and <tt>make 
menuconfig</tt>, 
of course, gives you the opportunity to fine-tune this configuration file. 
</p><p> 
Pay particular attention to the following: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> 
Life will be simpler if you skip loadable kernel module support 
and hard-compile everything into the kernel.  If you really want 
kernel modules, see the User-Mode Linux HOWTO, Section 2.2 (see 
Resources). 
</p></li><li><p> 
Under Processor type and features, double-check that your system 
architecture is set to um (User-Mode Linux), and make sure /proc/mm 
is enabled. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Under Networking options, make sure IP: tunneling and 802.1d Ethernet 
Bridging are enabled. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Under Network device support, enable Universal TUN/TAP device driver 
support. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Disable as many of the specialized hardware kernel modules as possible; this kernel 
is going to be running on virtualized hardware, so you won't need support 
for wireless LAN hardware, obscure parallel-port devices and so forth. 
</p></li></ul></div><p> 
Once you've saved your new configuration file, you can compile the 
kernel with this command (<span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> first becoming root; execute this as 
an unprivileged user): 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make linux ARCH=um 
</pre> 
<p> 
Note that I did <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> tell you to make a zipped or bzipped 
image.  Remember, you're going to be running this kernel as though it 
were a user-space command, so it shouldn't be compressed.  The finished 
kernel will be located in the top-level directory of your source tree 
(/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest in the above examples) and will be 
named linux--you'll probably want to rename it to something more 
descriptive, such as uml-guestkernel-2.6.17.3.  You'll also probably want 
to move it to the directory from which you intend to run it--perhaps 
something like /usr/local/uml/. 
</p><p> 
By the way, don't be scared by the size of your guest kernel file.  Most 
of that bulk is symbol information that will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be loaded into

Conclusion</div><p> 
Your host system now fully supports User-Mode Linux, and you've got a 
guest kernel image to run.  The next step is to obtain or create a root 
filesystem image to use with the guest kernel.  That's where we'll pick 
up again next time!

Here in the Paranoid Penguin column, we're in the midst of building a 
virtual network server using User-Mode Linux.  Last month, I explained 
why this is a good idea, how it works, how to prepare your host for 
optimized User-Mode Linux operation and how to build a kernel for your 
guest (virtual) system(s). 
</p><p> 
This month, we turn our attention to the guest system: how to obtain a 
prebuilt root filesystem image, how to configure networking on both your 
host and guest systems, and how to begin customizing the root filesystem 
image for your own purposes. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb44dd8"></a> 
Quick Review</div><p> 
First, here's a quick review of what we're trying to do, in case you missed 
last month's column.  Our objective is to use User-Mode Linux to create 
one or more virtual guest machines, each running a different network 
service.  That way, if one application (for example, BIND) on one guest 
machine gets compromised somehow, Sendmail, Apache and whatever else 
you've got running on other guest systems (or on the underlying host 
system itself) won't be affected. 
</p><p> 
(Per User-Mode Linux convention, we're using the word host to denote 
a system on top of which virtual machines run and the word guest to denote 
a virtual system instance.) 
</p><p> 
Debian is our somewhat arbitrary choice here for both host and 
guest systems, due to the ease with which you can create bare-bones 
Debian installations, though User-Mode Linux itself is decidedly 
distribution-agnostic.  We'll create a single guest system, running 
BIND software for DNS services. 
</p><p> 
On the strength of last month's procedures, hopefully you've got a 
skas-enabled host kernel and a guest kernel compiled for the um 
architecture.  Now, it's time to acquire or build a root filesystem image. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb44fe8"></a> 
Just What Is a Root Filesystem Image, and How Will It Be Used?</div><p> 
When your Linux host starts up, it learns where / is via the 
root command-line switch; somewhere in lilo.conf or menu.lst is a 
kernel-invocation line containing something like 
<tt>root=/dev/hda1</tt>.  That's 
how it works with User-Mode Linux too, except that rather than a physical 
hard disk, such as /dev/hda, we generally use a virtual disk in the form of 
a single flat file, called a root filesystem image. 
</p><p> 
The root filesystem image contains a complete Linux distribution.  You've 
already created similar image files yourself if you've ever copied a 
CD-ROM to an ISO file (or vice versa).  Using a filesystem that takes the 
form of a single file has two important ramifications for User-Mode Linux: 
first, it helps keep your guest system relatively compact and portable; 
second, it makes change control as simple as tracking changes to a single 
file, via the COW file method. 
</p><p> 
Suppose I start a User-Mode Linux guest with this command: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">   umluser@host:~&gt; ./guestkernel ubd0=mycow,my_root_fs root=/dev/ubda 
</pre> 
<p> 
Note the umluser@host prompt.  I'm executing this command from a 
shell session to which I'm logged in as a regular user, 
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> 
root.  guestkernel is my executable User-Mode Linux guest kernel; 
ubd0 is a virtual disk device I'm declaring to consist of the image 
file my_root_fs plus a change-on-write (COW) file called mycow. 
The root switch defines our root partition to be the virtual disk ubda 
(identified by its full path, /dev/ubda). 
</p><p> 
Somewhat confusingly, by convention, virtual disk declarations 
use numbered device names (ubd0, ubd1 and so on), but root filesystem 
definitions use the corresponding letters instead (ubda, ubdb and so on), 
which are synonymous.  The command <tt>./guestkernel ubda=mycow,my_root_fs 
root=/dev/ubda</tt> actually works just as well on my SUSE system as the 
above command, but your distribution of choice may behave differently. 
</p><p> 
Strictly speaking, the COW file is optional.  If you specify one, 
changes you make to the image file during your User-Mode Linux session 
will be written to the COW file rather than to the disk image itself.  If 
you omit the COW filename, the image file will be written to 
directly by the guest kernel--that is, any changes you make to your 
guest system will be "permanent". 
</p><p> 
As far as I'm concerned, when using UML in security scenarios, COW files 
are mandatory.  A key assumption in using User-Mode Linux for hosting 
a network service is that this service may be compromised in some way, 
and if it is, you'll want to be able to recover as quickly as possible.  If 
you use a COW file, all you'll need to do to restore a guest system to its 
baseline state is delete the old COW file and create a new (empty) one. 
</p><p> 
Another key advantage of using COW files is that they allow you to use the 
same root filesystem image on more than one guest system 
simultaneously. 
All you need to do is specify a different COW file each time you bring 
up a guest kernel.  In fact, you can use both the same image file and 
the same kernel for multiple guests.  As you can guess, we're going to 
use a COW file in our example scenarios. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb45510"></a> 
Getting a Root Filesystem Image</div><p> 
The procedure for building your own root filesystem image boils down 
to this: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p> 
Create an empty filesystem image file and mount it to some directory. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Install Linux into that directory. 
</p></li></ol></div><p> 
Sounds simple, right? On Debian and SUSE it is--sort of.  On other 
distributions, it's much less so.  Regardless, I'm going to save a 
more-detailed discussion of that process for my next column, in which 
I'll cover what I consider to be advanced User-Mode Linux topics and 
techniques.  In the interests of getting you up and running with User-Mode 
Linux in a gratifyingly quick manner, for now I recommend you download 
a prebuilt image. 
</p><p> 
My favorite source of these is Nagafix Ltd.'s "UML 
Resources" page (see the on-line Resources) from whence you can download root filesystem 
images for not only Debian guests, but also Gentoo, Slackware, Fedora, 
Ubuntu and others.  Nagafix makes a reasonable effort to keep these 
images up to date with security patches, which is a nice touch. 
</p><p> 
In addition, Nagafix provides an MD5 and SHA hash of each image file 
it provides.  You may miss them if you click directly on the x86 and 
AMD64 links on the page cited above; instead, use the OS-name links, 
each of which leads to a page containing links not only to images but 
also to build logs and hashes, plus handy tips on how to update the 
images yourself. 
</p><p> 
I obtained my Debian 3.1 image by navigating to <a href="http://uml.nagafix.co.uk/">uml.nagafix.co.uk</a>, 
clicking on Debian 3.1, and then clicking on the root_fs and 
MD5 links to download the files Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2 and 
Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2.md5, respectively.  After my downloads were 
complete (the filesystem image itself is 169MB!), I verified the MD5 
signature from within a terminal window with the command: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">   md5sum -c ./Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2.md5 
</pre> 
</div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb45a38"></a></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b> 
When in Doubt, Roll Your Own Image</b></p><p> 
Even if you use a root filesystem image from a trusted source and verify 
its integrity via an MD5, SHA or GPG hash/signature, the fact is, 
if you're truly worried about security (we are, aren't we?), you're much 
better off building your own filesystem image than using someone else's. 
</p><p> 
I'm indulging in just a little laziness and instant gratification by 
using a prebuilt image in this article, which I think is justifiable in 
the larger aim of encouraging UML experimentation and adoption.  Just 
be sure to check your image's hash/signature, and the first time you 
mount it in UML, run <tt>apt-get dist-upgrade</tt> (or YaST Online Update, yum 
or whatever update mechanism your guest's distro supports). 
</p><p> 
Next time, I'll discuss the filesystem image build process in more depth, 
as well as how to use iptables both on your host and on your guest OSes 
to add another layer of protection to your virtual machines. 
</p></div><p> 
And, now we're ready to boot our virtual guest for the first 
time.  We've got a guest kernel named uml-guestkernel-2.6.17.3 
(from my previous column's example) and a root filesystem image named 
Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2.  You should already be logged in to a terminal 
session as a nonroot user.  Uncompress the filesystem image with the 
command: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">   bunzip2 ./Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs.bz2 
</pre> 
<p> 
Next, just as a sanity 
check, try booting your guest system: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">   umluser@host:~&gt; ./uml-guestkernel-2.6.17.3 
   ubd0=testcow,Debian-3.1-x86-root_fs root=/dev/ubda 
</pre> 
<p> 
If all is well, you should see some User-Mode Linux messages, followed 
by a longer string of Linux kernel startup messages, ending with a login 
prompt.  Log in as root--you won't be prompted for a password.  Feel free 
to poke around a bit; you won't hurt anything that can't be fixed later 
by starting with a fresh COW file. 
</p><p> 
To see a list of installed packages, enter the command <tt>dpkg -l 
|less</tt>. 
You may be surprised by how few Debian packages are present.  Don't 
worry; you'll be able to install additional packets with apt-get, just 
like on a "real" Debian system.  When you're done with your initial 
exploration, issue the command <tt>halt</tt> to shut down your guest system 
cleanly.  We've got some things to do before your guest system can do 
any serious work--first and foremost is configuring networking. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb46010"></a> 
Using Bridged Networking with User-Mode Linux</div><p> 
There are a variety of ways to network UML guests, all of 
which are described in Rusty Russell's User-Mode Linux HOWTO (see 
Resources).  The 
best option for using UML guests as network servers is bridging, in 
which your host system acts like an Ethernet bridge between itself, 
the UML guests running on it and the outside world. 
</p><p> 
In a nutshell, the procedure is this: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p> 
Configure your host's TCP/IP stack as a virtual bridge, and then define 
your "real" network interface as the first 
"port" on that bridge. 
</p></li><li><p> 
For each guest system you intend to run, create a local tunnel interface 
and define it as another port on the bridge. 
</p></li><li><p> 
When you start a guest system, define its virtual Ethernet interface 
(eth0) to be the tunnel interface you created in the previous step. 
</p></li></ol></div><p> 
Listing 1 shows the precise series of commands this translates to, adapted 
from David Cannings' useful article "Networking UML Using 
Bridging".  All 
these commands must be executed as root. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb46538"></a></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b> 
Listing 1. Setting Up Bridged Networking</b></p><pre class="programlisting">   root@host# bash -c 'echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward' 
   root@host# apt-get install bridge-utils uml-utilities 
   root@host# ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 promisc up 
   root@host# brctl addbr uml-bridge 
   root@host# brctl setfd uml-bridge 0 
   root@host# brctl sethello uml-bridge 0 
   root@host# brctl stp uml-bridge off 
   root@host# ifconfig uml-bridge 192.168.250.250 netmask 255.255.255.0 up 
   root@host# brctl addif uml-bridge eth0 
   root@host# tunctl -u umluser -t uml-conn0 
   root@host# chgrp uml-net /dev/net/tun 
   root@host# chmod 660 /dev/net/tun 
   root@host# ifconfig uml-conn0 0.0.0.0 promisc up 
   root@host# brctl addif uml-bridge uml-conn0 
</pre></div><p> 
The first command enables IP forwarding on your host.  Although, 
technically, 
bridging happens at a lower level than IP forwarding, they amount to 
the same thing from the kernel's perspective.  Accordingly, if you have 
a local iptables policy on your host, you'll need to add rules to the 
FORWARD table to enable traffic to and from the tunnel interfaces you 
attach to the host's bridge. 
</p><p> 
The second command (apt-get install...), obviously, installs the Debian 
packages bridge-utils and uml-utilities.  bridge-utilities provides 
the brctl command, and uml-utilities provides the tunctl command.  For 
these commands to work, your host kernel needs to have been compiled with 
802.1d Ethernet bridging, IP tunneling, Bridged IP/ARP packet filtering 
and Universal TUN/TAP device driver support. 
</p><p> 
The third command in Listing 1 (ifconfig eth0...) may seem a bit 
scary.  It resets your host's Ethernet interface to a (temporarily) 
IP-free state.  Be prepared for an interruption in local network 
functionality after you execute this command. 
</p><p> 
The subsequent six commands, however, will restore it by defining a new 
virtual bridge device (called uml-bridge), configuring it, assigning 
your host's IP address to it (192.168.250.250 in this example), and 
attaching eth0 to it as a virtual bridge port.  If the IP address of eth0 
on your host was 10.1.1.10 before you reset it to 0.0.0.0, after 
issuing the first four brctl commands you would use <tt>ifconfig uml-bridge 
10.1.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up</tt>.  At this point, your host should be 
able to interact with the outside world in exactly the same way as it 
did before (unless of course your local iptables policy doesn't have 
appropriate FORWARD rules yet). 
</p><p> 
All right, our host system is now a bridge.  All that remains is to attach 
a tunnel port to it.  You should repeat the remaining steps in Listing 1 
(starting with tunctl -u...) for each guest system you intend to run. 
</p><p> 
In the tunctl -u... command, 
umluser is the name of the unprivileged 
account you intend to use when executing guest kernels, and uml-conn0 
is the name of the new tunnel interface you're creating. 
</p><p> 
In the subsequent chgrp and chmod commands, we're changing the 
permissions of the virtual tunnel device, always /dev/net/tun, to be 
readable and writable by our unprivileged account.  In this example, 
therefore, the account umluser belongs to the group uml-net.  (On my 
real-life test system, I instead used the the group wheel, which my 
unprivileged account mick belongs to.) 
</p><p> 
After setting the new tunnel interface's IP address to 0.0.0.0 (just like 
we did with eth0), we define it as another port on the local bridge with 
that last brctl command. 
</p><p> 
That's it! Now when we start the guest system, we add the option 
<tt>eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0</tt> to our kernel command line, which tells the 
kernel to use the tunnel interface uml-conn0 as its virtual eth0.  Our 
complete example command line, which unlike Listing 1, should be run by 
a nonprivileged user rather than root, looks like this: 
 
</p><pre class="programlisting">   umluser@host$ ./debkern ubd0=debcow,debroot root=/dev/ubda 
   eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0 
</pre> 
<p> 
After the virtual machine starts, you can assign an IP address 
to (virtual) eth0 via <tt>ifconfig</tt>, define a default route via <tt>route 
add...</tt> (using the same gateway IP that your host system uses), set DNS 
lookup information in /etc/resolv.conf, and, in short, configure it in 
precisely the same way that you'd configure a real Debian system. 
</p><p> 
Once your virtual machine is successfully communicating with your local 
LAN and beyond, you should immediately configure apt-get and use it to 
install the latest Debian patches on your virtual guest.  You'll need 
apt-get working anyhow to install the network software you've just gone 
to all the trouble of building this virtual machine to run.  In the case 
of our example virtual DNS server, these would probably be the Debian 
packages bind9 and maybe also bind9-doc.  Remember, all of these 
changes will be made to your COW file, so be sure to specify the same 
COW file on subsequent startups (or merge it into your image via the 
uml_moo command). 
</p><p> 
Next time, we'll wrap up this series by discussing additional security 
controls you can use on your guest systems, a nifty COW file trick or two 
and, of course, how to create a custom root filesystem image.  Until then, 
be safe!

      <h3>Paranoid Penguin - Running Network Services under User-Mode Linux, Part III</h3> 
   
        <h4>January 1st, 2007 by <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/user/800787" title="View user profile.">Mick Bauer</a><span class="taxonomy"></h4> 
  <div class="content"> 
        Fine-tune and firewall your UML guest systems.     
<p> 
In the last two Paranoid Penguin columns, I walked you through the process of 
building a virtual network server using User-Mode Linux.  We built both 
host and guest kernels, obtained a prebuilt root filesystem image, 
configured networking on the host, and when we left off last month, 
we finally had booted our guest kernel with bridged networking, ready for 
configuration, patching and server software installation. 
</p><p> 
This month, I tie up some loose ends in our example guest 
system's startup and configuration, show you the uml_moo command, 
demonstrate how to write firewall rules on your UML host system, offer 
some miscellaneous security tips and give some pointers on creating your 
own root filesystem image.  And, can you believe we will have scratched 
only the surface of User-Mode Linux, even after three articles? 
Hopefully, 
we'll have scratched deeply enough for you to be off to a good start! 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb44dd8"></a> 
Guest System Configuration</div><p> 
You may recall that last time we set up bridged networking on our host, 
creating a local tunnel interface called uml-conn0 that we bridged 
to the host system's "real" eth0 interface.  If you don't have last 
month's column, my procedure was based on the one by David Cannings (see 
the on-line Resources).  When we then started up our host 
(User-Mode) kernel, we mapped a virtual eth0 on the guest to uml-conn0 
via a kernel parameter, like so:</p><pre class="programlisting">umluser@host$ ./debkern ubd0=debcow,debroot 
 root=/dev/ubda eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0</pre><p> 
The last parameter, obviously, contains the networking magic: 
eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0.  It can be translated to "the guest kernel's eth0 
interface is the host system's tunnel/tap interface uml-conn0".  This is 
important to understand; to the host (real) system, the guest's Ethernet 
interface is called uml-conn0, but to the guest system itself, its 
Ethernet interface is plain-old eth0. 
</p><p> 
Therefore, if you run an iptables (firewall) rule set on either host 
or guest (I strongly recommend you do so at least on the host), any 
rules that use interface names as sources or targets must take this 
difference in nomenclature into account.  We'll discuss some example 
host firewall rules shortly, but we're not quite done with guest-kernel 
startup parameters yet. 
</p><p> 
Going back to that startup line, we've got definitions of our virtual 
hard drive (ubd0, synonymous with ubda), our path to virtual root 
and, of course, our virtual Ethernet interface.  But what about memory? 
</p><p> 
On my OpenSUSE 10.1 host system, running a UML Debian guest with the 
above startup line resulted in a default memory size of about 
29MB--pretty puny by modern standards, especially if I want that guest 
system 
to run real-world, Internet-facing network services. Furthermore, I've 
got an entire gigabyte of physical RAM on my host system to allocate; 
I easily can spare 256MB of RAM for my guest system. 
</p><p> 
To do so, all I have to do is pass the parameter mem=256M to the guest 
kernel, like so:</p><pre class="programlisting">umluser@host$ ./debkern mem=256M ubd0=debcow,debroot 
 root=/dev/ubda eth0=tuntap,uml-conn0</pre><p> 
Obviously enough, you can specify however much more or less than that as 
you like, and you can allocate different amounts of RAM for multiple guests 
running on a single host (perhaps 128M for your virtual DNS server, 
but 512M for your virtual Web server, for example).  Just be sure to leave 
enough non-guest-allocated RAM for your host system to do what 
<span class="emphasis"><em>it</em></span> 
needs to do. 
</p><p> 
Speaking of which, you'll save a lot of RAM on your host system by not 
running the X Window System, which I've always recommended against running 
on hardened servers anyhow.  The X server on my test host uses around 
100MB, with actual desktop managers requiring more.  On top of this, the X 
Window System has a history of security vulnerabilities with varying degrees 
of exploitability by remote attackers (remember, a "local" vulnerability 
ceases being local the moment any non-local user starts a shell). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb45358"></a> 
Managing COW Files</div><p> 
If, as I recommended last month, you run your UML guest with a Copy on 
Write (COW) file, you may be wondering whether your UML guest-kernel 
startup line is the only place you can manage COW files.  (A COW file 
is created automatically when you specify a filename for one in your 
ubd0=... parameter.) 
</p><p> 
Actually, the uml-utilities package includes two standalone commands 
for managing COW files: uml_moo and uml_mkcow.  Of the two, uml_moo is 
the most likely to be useful to you.  You can use uml_moo to merge all 
the filesystem changes contained in a COW file into its parent root 
filesystem image. 
</p><p> 
For example, if I run the example UML guest kernel startup command 
described earlier, and from within that UML guest session I configure 
networking, apply all the latest security patches, install BIND v9 and 
configure it and finally achieve a "production-ready" state, I may 
decide that it's time to take a snapshot of the UML guest by merging 
all those changes (written, so far, only into the file debcow) into 
the actual filesystem image (debroot).  To do so, I'd use this command:</p><pre class="programlisting">umluser@host$ uml_moo ./debcow newdebroot</pre><p> 
The first argument 
you specify to uml_moo is the COW file you want to merge.  Because a COW 
file contains the name of the filesystem image to which it corresponds, you 
don't have to specify this.  Normally, however, you should specify the 
name of the new filesystem image you want to create. 
</p><p> 
My example uml_moo command, therefore, will leave the old root filesystem 
image debroot intact (maybe it's also being used by other UML guests, 
or maybe I simply want to preserve a clean image), creating a new 
filesystem named newdebroot that contains my fully configured and 
updated root filesystem. 
</p><p> 
If I want to do a hard merge, however, which replaces the old filesystem 
image with the merged one (with the same filename as before), perhaps 
because my hard disk is too full for extra image files, I'd instead use 
<tt>uml_moo -d ./debcow</tt> (the -d stands for destructive merge). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb45778"></a> 
iptables and UML</div><p> 
Whether you chroot your User-Mode guests, and whether you use 
SELinux, depends on how deep you want your layers of security 
to go and how much time and effort you're able to expend.  However, I 
strongly recommend that on any Internet-facing, bridged User-Mode Linux 
system, you use iptables on your UML host to restrict your guest systems' 
network behavior. 
</p><p> 
On the one hand, if your UML system already resides outside a firewall 
in a DMZ network (as should any Internet server), you're already 
protecting your internal network from the possibility of a network 
server compromise.  However, there's really no good reason not to take the 
opportunity also to use UML-host iptables rules to reduce the ability of 
an attacker to use one compromised UML guest to attack other UML guests, 
the UML host itself or other systems in your DMZ network. 
</p><p> 
There are two categories of rules I strongly recommend you 
consider.  First, anti-IP-spoofing rules can help ensure that every 
packet sent by each guest bears the source IP address you actually 
assigned to that guest, and not a forged (spoofed) source IP.  These are 
low-maintenance rules that you'll have to think about only at setup time, 
unless for some reason you change a guest system's IP address. 
</p><p> 
Suppose you have a UML system whose IP address is 10.1.1.10 and whose 
tun/tap interface is (from the host's perspective) uml-conn0.  The 
anti-spoofing rules you install on the UML host might therefore look 
like that shown in Listing 1. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb45988"></a></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b> 
Listing 1. Anti-IP-Spoofing Rules</b></p><pre class="programlisting">iptables -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-in uml-conn0 
 -s ! 10.1.1.10 -j LOG --log-prefix "Spoof from uml-conn0" 
 
iptables -A FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-in uml-conn0 
 -s ! 10.1.1.10 -j DROP</pre></div><p> 
The first rule logs the spoofed packets; the second one actually drops 
them.  As you may know, the LOG target doesn't cause packets to cease 
being evaluated against subsequent iptables rules, but the DROP target 
does, so the LOG rule must come before the DROP rule. 
</p><p> 
Due to space constraints, I can't launch into a primer on how to write 
iptables rules or how they're managed on your Linux distribution of 
choice.  But, I can talk about the bridge-specific magic in Listing 1: 
the physdev iptables module and the --physdev-in parameter. 
</p><p> 
Usually, we use iptables' -i and -o flags to denote which network 
interface packets are received and sent from, respectively.  However, 
when writing iptables rules on a system doing bridged networking, we 
need to be a bit more precise, especially when we're also using tun/tap 
interfaces, as eth0 then takes on a different role than in normal 
Layer 3 (routed) networking. 
</p><p> 
Therefore, where we might normally use <tt>-i 
uml-conn0</tt> in a rule, 
on a bridging host, we should instead use <tt>-m physdev --physdev-in 
uml-conn0</tt>.  Similarly, instead of <tt>-o 
uml-conn0</tt>, we'd use <tt>-m physdev 
--physdev-out uml-conn0</tt>.  As with other module invocations, you 
need only one instance of <tt>-m physdev</tt> if a given 
iptables rule uses both the 
--physdev-in and --physdev-out rules. 
</p><p> 
After setting up a pair of anti-IP-spoofing rules, you also should create 
a set of "service-specific" rules that actually govern how your guest 
system may interact with the rest of the world, including other guest 
systems and the host itself. 
</p><p> 
Remember that in our example scenario the guest system is a DNS 
server.  Therefore, I'm going to enforce this logical firewall policy: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p> 
The UML guest may accept DNS queries (both TCP and UDP). 
</p></li><li><p> 
The UML guest may recurse DNS queries against upstream (external) 
servers. 
</p></li><li><p> 
The UML guest may send its log messages to a log server (called 
logserver). 
</p></li><li><p> 
The UML host may initiate SSH sessions on the UML guest. 
</p></li></ol></div><p> 
Listing 2 shows iptables commands that could enforce this policy. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb462d0"></a></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

 state --state NEW -j ACCEPT</pre></div><p> 
Listing 2 has two parts: a complete set of FORWARD rules and a single 
OUTPUT rule.  Because, logically speaking, UML guest systems are 
"external" 
to the UML host's kernel, interactions between UML guests and each other, 
and also interactions between UML guests and the rest of the world, 
are handled via FORWARD rules.  Interactions between UML guests and the 
underlying host system, however, are handled by INPUT and OUTPUT rules 
(just like any other interactions between external systems and the 
host system). 
</p><p> 
Because all of my logical rules except #4 are enforced by iptables FORWARD 
rules, Listing 2 shows my UML host's complete FORWARD table, including an 
initial rule allowing packets associated with already-approved sessions, 
and a final pair of "default log &amp; drop" rules.  Note my use of the physdev 
module; I like to use interface-specific rather than IP-specific rules 
wherever possible, as that tends to make it harder for attackers to 
play games with IP headers. 
</p><p> 
The last rule in Listing 2 should, in actual practice, appear somewhere 
in the middle of a similar block of OUTPUT rules (beginning with an 
allow-established rule and ending with a default log/drop rule pair), 
but I wanted to illustrate that where the source or destination of a 
rule involves the UML host system, you can write an ordinary OUTPUT or 
INPUT rule (respectively) rather than a FORWARD rule. 
</p><p> 
Because your UML host is acting as an Ethernet bridge, you can write 
still-more-granular and low-level firewall rules--even filtering by 
MAC addresses, the ARP protocol and so forth.  But for that level of 
filtering, you'll need to install the ebtables command.  iptables rules 
of the type I've just described should, however, suffice for most 
bastion-host situations. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb3cfe8"></a> 
Miscellaneous Security Notes</div><p> 
If you patched your UML host's kernel with the SKAS patch, you've already 
got reasonably good assurance that an attacker who compromises a UML 
guest won't be able to do much, if anything, on the host system.  However, 
I'm not one to argue against paranoia, so I also recommend you chroot 
your UML guest system.  This is described in detail on the UML Wiki (see 
Resources).  And, what about shell access 
to your UML guests? There are various ways to access "local 
consoles".  You 
get one automatically when you start your UML guest from a UML 
host shell manually--after your UML kernel loads, you'll be presented with a 
login prompt. 
</p><p> 
That doesn't do you much good if you start your UML guest automatically 
from a script, however.  The "Device Inputs" page on the User-Mode Linux 
home page (see Resources) describes 
how to map UML guest virtual serial lines to UML host consoles.  For me, 
however, it's easiest simply to install SSH on my UML guest system, 
configure and start its SSH dæmon, and create a firewall rule that 
allows connections to it only from my UML host. 
</p><p> 
Generally speaking, you want to use the same security controls and tools 
on your UML guest (tripwire, chrooted applications, SELinux, tcpwrappers 
and so on) as you would on any other bastion server.

Building Your Own Root Filesystem Image</div><p> 
Describing in detail the process of building your own root filesystem 
image from scratch would require its own article (one which I may yet 
write).  Suffice it to say, the process is all but identical to that 
of creating your own bootable Linux CD or DVD, without the final step 
of burning your image file to some portable medium.  There are three 
major steps: 
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p> 
Create an empty filesystem image file with <tt>dd</tt>. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Format the image file. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Mount it to a directory via loopback. 
</p></li><li><p> 
Install Linux into it. 
</p></li></ol></div><p> 
The first three steps are the easiest.  To create a 1GB ext3 image file, 
I'd run the commands shown in Listing 3 as root. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><a name="N0xa50890.0xb3d720"></a></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b> 
Listing 3. Making and Mounting an Empty Filesystem Image</b></p><pre class="programlisting">dd if=/dev/zero of=./mydebroot bs=1024K count=1000 
mkfs.ext4 ./mydebroot 
mkdir /mnt/debian 
mount -o loop ./mydebroot /mnt/debian</pre></div><p> 
Installing Linux into this directory gets a bit more involved, but if 
you've got a SUSE host system, the Software module in YaST includes a 
wizard called "Installation into Directory".  Like other YaST modules, 
this is an easy-to-use GUI. 
</p><p> 
Similarly, if you run Debian, you can use the command 
<tt>debootstrap</tt>.  See 
Michael McCabe and Demetrios Dimatos' handy article "Installing User 
Mode Linux" for detailed instructions on using debootstrap to populate 
your root filesystem image. 
</p><p> 
See the UML Wiki for some pointers to similar utilities in other 
distributions.  The Linux Bootdisk HOWTO (see Resources), 
although not 
specific to UML, is also useful.

Conclusion</div><p> 
I hope you're well on your way to building your own 
virtual network servers using User-Mode Linux! The two most 
important sources of UML information are the UML home page 
and the UML Wiki (see Resources).  Those and the other Web sites 
mentioned in this piece should help you go much further with User-Mode 
Linux than I can take you in an introductory series of articles like 
this.  Have fun, and be safe!

time, synchronously. 2.6 AIO is a thread which uses the 2.6 AIO 
interface to handle an arbitrary number of pending requests. 2.6 AIO is 
not available in tt mode, on 2.4 hosts, or when UML is built with 
/usr/include/linux/aio_abi.h not available. Many distributions don't 
include aio_abi.h, so you will need to copy it from a kernel tree to 
your /usr/include/linux in order to build an AIO-capable UML.</p>
