  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><h4>Introduction</h4><p>It's
 often desirable to make slight changes to U-Boot in order to adapt it 
to custom hardware. For example, supporting board-specific features or 
adding a few routines that give the end-user signs that the device has 
indeed powered on, and that something is happening while the boot 
process takes place.</p><p>The short tutorial focuses on U-Boot for ARM,
 but the techniques used on other architectures are similar and often 
exactly the same. It's assumed that the reader is familiar with U-Boot 
usage at the command level as well as compilation and deployment.</p><p>It's most recommended to read the README file in the project's root directory first. It covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>The source file tree structure</li><li>The meaning of the CONFIG defines</li><li>Instructions for building U-Boot.</li><li>How to port U-Boot to new platforms</li><li>A brief description of the Hush shell</li><li>How to build the Linux image (mkimage)</li><li>A list of common environment variables</li><li>The "Hello world" example and how to use it</li></ul><p>boards.cfg contains a list of supported boards. It's worth to take a look at it as well.</p><p>This tutorial was written with respect to&nbsp; U-Boot version v2013.07, but the principles apply for a wide range of versions.</p><h4>Sensible Hacking</h4><p>The
 immediate instinct when encountering a large chunk of software sources 
is to look for the first place to inject a small hack, and hardcode the 
necessary functionality. Not only will this probably lead to daunting 
re-hacking and recompilations in the future, but it's unnecessary: 
U-Boot is actually laid out to make it easy to add custom functionality.</p><p>One can divide possible modifications into three sorts:</p><ul><li>Modifications in U-Boot's initialization process, so that a custom board's specific hardware is set up early enough</li><li>Adding support to specific hardware, by virtue of adding or modifying low-level drivers</li><li>Expanding the command interface to support a needed functionality, possibly as a front-end for new hardware</li></ul><p>It
 may be tempting to add a few lines of hack code in the board's 
initialization routine to perform a specific operation. This will most 
likely work, but as just mentioned, hardcoding has its disadvantages. 
Writing a small custom driver and command support is by far more elegant
 and reusable, if the hardware's setup can be deferred to the command 
execution stage.</p><p>This tutorial is divided into three parts: A 
general view on U-Boot (this part), a hands-on explanation on how to add
 functionality (part II) and some background on U-Boot's bring-up 
process, for those who need to initialize something very early (part 
III).</p><h4>Software organization</h4><p>Linux kernel hackers will feel
 relatively comfortable with U-Boot, as much of the coding style and 
organization is inspired by the Linux kernel. The structure is however 
simpler at the cost of less flexibility. There's no intermediate layer 
between the drivers and the user front-end.</p><p>For example, to get 
the value of a GPIO pin, just call gpio_get_value(gpio) with the GPIO's 
pin number from anywhere in the code. There is no place for more than 
one GPIO driver to be compiled into the system: Only one source file, 
which defines this function, may be enabled for compilation, or the 
linking will fail. And of course, if gpio_get_value() is used somewhere,
 this one source file must be compiled.</p><p>So a "hardware driver" in 
U-Boot is just a piece of code that implements a set of functions that 
are linked into the global name space. It kinda makes sense for a 
utility that needs to be compact: There's no point compiling in anything
 that isn't used, and most of the time there's a fixed set of hardware 
involved, with one instance of each kind, at most.</p><p>One driver may,
 of course, depend on the other. For example, the SOFT_I2C driver 
depends on two GPIO pins that are connected to an I2C device. These pins
 are accessed using the GPIO's API functions. Any other piece of 
software can access the GPIO API as well (hopefully not the same pins).</p><h4>Behind the scenes of make XXX_config</h4><p>Anyone who has built U-Boot has typed something like</p>
<pre>$ make zynq_zed_config</pre>
<p>before compiling the project. Many have also spotted that there's a 
/include/configs/ directory, in which corresponding files are found, for
 example zynq_zed.h, which reads something like this (GPLv2 header at 
the top not shown here):</p>
<pre>#ifndef __CONFIG_ZYNQ_ZED_H
#define __CONFIG_ZYNQ_ZED_H

#define PHYS_SDRAM_1_SIZE (512 * 1024 * 1024)

#define CONFIG_ZYNQ_SERIAL_UART1
#define CONFIG_ZYNQ_GEM0
#define CONFIG_ZYNQ_GEM_PHY_ADDR0	0

#define CONFIG_SYS_NO_FLASH

#define CONFIG_ZYNQ_SDHCI0
#define CONFIG_ZYNQ_QSPI
#define CONFIG_ZYNQ_BOOT_FREEBSD

#include &lt;configs/zynq_common.h&gt;

#endif /* __CONFIG_ZYNQ_ZED_H */</pre>
<p>This is in fact just the tip of the iceberg. Among others, this "make
 zynq_zed_config" command generates include/config.h. as follows:</p>
<pre>/* Automatically generated - do not edit */
#define CONFIG_SYS_ARCH&nbsp; "arm"
#define CONFIG_SYS_CPU&nbsp;&nbsp; "armv7"
#define CONFIG_SYS_BOARD "zynq"
#define CONFIG_SYS_VENDOR "xilinx"
#define CONFIG_SYS_SOC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "zynq"
#define CONFIG_BOARDDIR board/xilinx/zynq
#include &lt;config_cmd_defaults.h&gt;

#include &lt;config_defaults.h&gt;
#include &lt;configs/<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>zynq_zed.h</strong></span>&gt;
#include &lt;asm/config.h&gt;
#include &lt;config_fallbacks.h&gt;
#include &lt;config_uncmd_spl.h&gt;</pre>
<p>The included config files contains other #define (and possibly 
#undef) statements, most of which for variables with a CONFIG_* prefix.</p><p>At
 this point, it's quite clear that there's a somewhat tangled set of 
header files that define CONFIG_* compilation variables (and others). 
These affect the way the code is compiled in two ways:</p><ol><li>All 
CONFIG_* variables that are defined turn into Makefile variables in 
include/autoconf.mk, where each variable that is just defined (as 
opposed to assigned a value) gets the value "y". This is used in the 
Makefiles in each source directory to pick which files are compiled and 
linked into the main executable.</li><li>These compilation variables are used in the compiled C sources directly, and may contain target-specific attributes.</li></ol><p>Unlike
 the Linux kernel, there is no KConfig utility, so these definitions are
 made in board-specific h-files. To add a new "make config" target, 
create a new config file in include/configs/ (or better, copy a similar 
configuration file), and add a line in boards.cfg.</p><h4>The three functions of code in U-Boot</h4><p>One can divide the code into three types (parallel to the sorts of modifications, mentioned above):</p><ul><li>Pure initialization code: This code always runs during U-Boot's own bring-up. More about the stages of this in part III.</li><li>"Drivers":
 Code that implements a set of functions, which gives access to a 
certain piece of hardware. Much of this is found in drivers/, fs/ and 
others</li><li>Commands: Adding commands to the U-Boot shell, and 
implementing their functionality, typically based upon calls to driver 
API. These appear as common/cmd_*.c</li></ul><p>All three code types are
 strongly influenced by the CONFIG defines. For example, a CONFIG that 
enables the compilation of a certain driver may also cause a snippet of 
initialization code to opt in with #ifdef.</p><p>The typical way to add a
 completely new functionality to U-Boot is writing driver code, writing 
the command front-end for it, and enable them both with CONFIG flags. In
 some cases, a segment is added in the initialization sequence, in order
 to prepare the hardware before any command is issued.</p>

<a name="PartII"></a><h4>Example: Adding GPIO support</h4>

<p>U-Boot supports GPIO on several platforms, but is often not enabled. We'll 
briefly walk through the process of enabling this functionality, 
possibly for a new platform.</p><p>Looking in the common/ directory, 
it's quite easy to spot the cmd_gpio.c file. It contains code handling 
the "gpio" command in U-Boot's shell.</p><p>Its last few lines say:</p>
<pre>U_BOOT_CMD(gpio, 3, 0, do_gpio,
  "input/set/clear/toggle gpio pins",
  "&lt;input|set|clear|toggle&gt; &lt;pin&gt;\n"
  "    - input/set/clear/toggle the specified pin");</pre>
<p>This declares do_gpio() as the function to handle for the "gpio" command. It also says that up to <strong>two</strong>
 arguments are allowed (the number 3 includes the command itself), and 
that autorepeat is not allowed. There are also the short and long help 
strings. The U_BOOT_CMD macro is explained in doc/README.commands.</p><p>The
 do_gpio() function is in essence an argc/argv function, with some extra
 parameters that are not used in most implementations. So it's down to 
parsing the arguments and call lower-level functions, usually from some 
driver API.</p><p>It's quite pointless to go through cmd_gpio.c in 
detail -- the principle of how the commands are interpreted and executed 
is easily understood by reading it and other cmd_*.c files. In most 
cases, it's simpler than one would expect.</p><p>As for the interaction with the build system, it's quite simple as well: Somewhere in common/Makefile, there's a line saying</p>
<pre>COBJS-$(CONFIG_CMD_GPIO) += cmd_gpio.o</pre>
<p>Without getting into the tangled parts of the build system, this line
 means that if CONFIG_CMD_GPIO is defined in the Config chain, 
cmd_gpio.c will be compiled into cmd_gpio.o, and linked into the global 
project. The U_BOOT_CMD() macro makes sure that the command is enlisted 
in the U-Boot shell interpreter.</p><p>But we're not done yet. For example, in cmd_gpio.c, there a place saying</p>
<pre>if (sub_cmd == GPIO_INPUT) {
    gpio_direction_input(gpio);
    value = gpio_get_value(gpio);
}</pre>
<p>The functions gpio_direction_input() and gpio_get_value() are not 
defined in cmd_gpio.c itself. Rather, it's expected that they'll be 
defined by some other file (a "driver") which is compiled and linked 
into the global executable.</p><p>As one would expect, there are many 
candidate C files in drivers/gpio/, each named after the platform it's 
intended for. They all implement more or less the same set of functions,
 and in a pretty similar way. The low-level implementation varies, of 
course.</p><p>Only one of these can be compiled, of course. Which one depends which CONFIG is defined (if at all).</p><p>The Makefile in drivers/gpio/ is similar, with lines saying</p>
<pre><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">[ ... ]</span>
COBJS-$(CONFIG_BCM2835_GPIO)	+= bcm2835_gpio.o
COBJS-$(CONFIG_S3C2440_GPIO)	+= s3c2440_gpio.o
COBJS-$(CONFIG_XILINX_GPIO)	+= xilinx_gpio.o
COBJS-$(CONFIG_ADI_GPIO2)	+= adi_gpio2.o

<span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">[ ... ]</span></pre>
<p>So all in all, to use Xilinx' GPIO, the two following lines should appear in the board's configuration file:</p>
<pre>#define CONFIG_CMD_GPIO
#define CONFIG_XILINX_GPIO</pre>
<p>Note that sometimes additional configuration variables are necessary.
 Which ones and what they mean is often easiest to deduce by reading the
 driver's source code.</p><p>To add a driver for a yet unsupported piece
 of hardware, it's recommended to look at the existing drivers, and see 
if there's one that works almost as required. Sometimes it's possible to
 tweak it with #ifdef's to make it support the desired hardware.</p><p>If
 this is not the case, the recommended practice is to make copy of the 
driver that seems to be closest to the desired functionality, and make 
changes as necessary. In order to include the new driver in the build 
system, add a COBJ-$() += ... line in the Makefile of the same directory, 
and a corresponding (new) CONFIG flag to enable it.</p>

<h4>Available API</h4><p>Every
 function within U-Boot can be accessed by any code, but some functions 
are more used than others. Looking at other drivers and cmd_*.c files 
usually gives an idea on how to write new code. Much of the classic C 
API is supported, even things one wouldn't expect in a small boot 
loader.</p><p>There are a few functions in the API that are worth to mention:</p><ul><li>Registers are accessed with writel() and readl() etc. like in Linux, as defined in arch/arm/include/asm/io.h</li><li>The
 environment can be accessed with functions such as setenv(), 
setenv_ulong(), setenv_hex(), getenv(), getenv_ulong() and getenv_hex().
 These, and other functions are defined in common/cmd_nvedit.c</li><li>printf() and vprintf() are available, as well as getc(), putc() and puts().</li><li>There's gunzip() and zunzip() for uncompressing data.</li><li>The lib/ directory contains several library functions for handling strings, CRC, hash tables, sorting, encryption and others.</li><li>It's worth looking in include/common.h for some basic API functions.</li></ul><hr>

<h4>U-Boot's bring-up</h4>

<p>Even though unnecessary in most cases, it's sometimes desired to modify 
U-Boot's own bring-up process, in particular for initializing custom 
hardware during early stages. This section explains the basics of this 
part of U-Boot.</p><p>U-Boot is one of the first things to run on the 
processor, and may be responsible for the most basic hardware 
initialization. On some platforms the processor's RAM isn't configured 
when U-Boot starts running, so the underlying assumption is that U-Boot 
may run directly from ROM (typically flash memory).</p><p>The bring-up 
process' key event is hence when U-Boot copies itself from where it runs
 in the beginning into RAM, from which it runs the more sophisticated 
tasks (handling boot commands in particular). This self-copy is referred
 to as "relocation".</p><p>Almost needless to say, the processor runs in
 "real mode": The MMU, if there is one, is off. There is no memory 
translation nor protection. U-Boot plays a few dirty tricks based on 
this.</p><p>In gross terms, the U-Boot loader runs through the following phases:</p><ul><li>Pre-relocation initialization (possibly directly from flash or other kind of ROM)</li><li>Relocation: Copy the code to RAM.</li><li>Post-relocation initialization (from proper RAM).</li><li>Execution of commands: Through autoboot or console shell</li><li>Passing control to the Linux kernel (or other target application)</li></ul><p>Note
 that in several scenarios, U-Boot starts from proper RAM to begin with,
 and consequently there is no actual relocation taking place. The 
division into pre-relocation and post-relocation becomes somewhat 
artificial in these scenarios, yet this is the terminology.</p>

<h4>A more detailed look</h4>

<p>The sequence for the ARM architecture can be deduced from 
arch/arm/lib/crt0.S, which is the absolutely first thing that runs. This
 piece of assembly code calls functions as follows (along with some very
 low-level initializations):</p><ul><li>board_init_f() (defined in e.g. 
arch/arm/lib/board.c): Calls the functions listed in the init_sequence_f
 function pointer array (using initcall_run_list() ), which is enlisted 
in this file with a lot of ifdefs. This function then runs various 
ifdef-dependent init snippets.</li><li>relocate_code()</li><li>coloured_LED_init()
 and red_led_on() are directly called by crt0.S. Defining these 
functions allow hooking visible indications of early boot progress.</li><li>board_init_r()
 (also possibly defined in arch/arm/lib/board.c): Runs the 
initialization as a "normal" program running from RAM. This function 
never returns. Rather,</li><li>board_init_r()&nbsp; loops on main_loop()
 (defined in common/main.c) forever. This is essentially the autoboot or
 execution of commands from input by the command parser (most likely 
hush).</li><li>At some stage, a command in main_loop() gives the control to the Linux kernel (or whatever was loaded instead).</li></ul><p>For
 those who wish to add some code during these init stages: 
CONFIG_BOARD_EARLY_INIT_F, CONFIG_BOARD_EARLY_INIT_R, 
CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INIT and CONFIG_BOARD_POSTCLK_INIT can be defined to 
request a call to board_early_init_f(), board_early_init_r(), 
board_late_init() and board_postclk_init() in the respective stages. 
These can be used as simple hooks for whatever platform-specific 
functionality is needed.</p>

<h4>SPL boot</h4>

<p>The SPL (Secondary 
Program Loader) boot feature is irrelevant in most scenarios, but offers
 a solution As U-Boot itself is too large for the platform's boot 
sequence. For example, the ARM processor's hardware boot loader in 
Altera's SoC FPGAs can only handle a 60 kB image. A typical U-Boot ELF 
easily reaches 300 kB (after stripping).</p><p>The point with an SPL is 
to create a very small preloader, which loads the "full" U-Boot image. 
It's built from U-Boot's sources, but with a minimal set of code. So 
when U-Boot is built for a platform that requires SPL, it's typically 
done twice: Once for generating the SPL, and a second time for the full 
U-Boot.</p><p>The SPL build is done with the CONFIG_SPL_BUILD is 
defined. Only the pre-location phase runs on SPL builds. All it does is 
the minimal set of initializations, then loads the full U-Boot image, 
and passes control to it.</p></div></div></div>
