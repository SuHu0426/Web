<P> Storage virtualization is one of the big reasons private cloud infrastructures 
are so efficient and scalable. To capitalize fully on the benefits of virtual 
storage, however, cloud computing service providers must have a working knowledge 
of several potentially unfamiliar technologies and techniques.  This white paper 
introduces readers to key storage virtualization concepts and explores best practices 
for configuring and maintaining a virtual storage infrastructure. It draws heavily on 
input from these storage experts:

<h4>Definition and Benefits of Storage Virtualization</h4>

<P> Virtual storage solutions enable multiple servers to share a common data 
repository. That allows companies to manage data centrally and utilize disk space 
efficiently instead of maintaining dozens of underused hard drives in separate 
locations. In addition, storage virtualization improves storage performance by 
letting multiple disks serve workloads simultaneously.  By equipping private 
clouds to store data in several places, so that the failure of one or even 
several disks doesn't produce data loss, virtual storage solutions enhance data 
protection as well.  In fact, private cloud computing would be all but impossible 
without consolidated, virtual storage. The ability to spawn new virtual servers 
rapidly and migrate them to new host devices on the fly are both central to how 
private clouds keep availability and scalability high. Neither would be possible 
without centralized storage.

<h4>Understanding Essential Virtual Storage Concepts</h4>

<P> A basic comprehension of fundamental technologies and terminology is critical 
to implementing successful virtual storage environments. Among the most important 
concepts to know are these:

<OL>
  <LI> <h5>Protocols</h5>

<P> Most storage virtualization solutions use storage-area network <b>(SAN)</b> 
technology to store block-level data and network-attached storage <b>(NAS)</b> 
technology to store files. SANs typically employ one of the following two protocols 
to connect and manage storage assets:

  <OL>
    <LI> Fibre Channel. The oldest and still generally fastest SAN protocol, Fibre 
         Channel is also usually the most expensive, since it relies on dedicated 
         cabling and requires specialized technical skills.

    <LI> iSCSI. SANs that use the iSCSI protocol tend to be more cost-effective than 
         Fibre Channel SANs, because iSCSI runs on existing network infrastructure 
         and is based on familiar Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) technology.
  </OL>


<P> NAS solutions typically use the Network File System (NFS) protocol, which allows 
servers and desktops to access files over a LAN or WAN much the way PCs access files 
on a local hard drive.

  <LI> <h5>Performance</h5>

<P> As a rule, virtual storage solutions perform faster than conventional storage 
architectures. To collect all of the performance benefits storage virtualization makes 
possible, however, organizations must carefully measure the performance needs of their 
servers and the performance capabilities of their storage systems. The metric used to 
express those measurements is called "input/output operations per second," or IOPS. 
Put simply, IOPS quantifies the number of read and write commands a given disk can 
perform each second. Technicians can use a variety of benchmarking and performance 
monitoring tools to calculate their IOPS requirements and capacity.

  <LI> <h5>Hard Drive Technologies</h5>

<P> Broadly speaking, storage virtualization solutions use some combination of two 
kinds of hard drive: disk based and solid state. Solid-state drives (SSDs) tend to be 
faster than diskbased drives but also cost more. 

<P> A similar dynamic distinguishes the two interface technologies that most virtual 
storage systems use to transfer data to and from hard drives: Serial Attached SCSI 
(SAS) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA). In general, SAS drives offer 
speedier performance than SATA drives but are also more expensive.

<P> <Em>Determining capacity requirements is partly artwork, partly common sense, and 
partly dependent on the technology you're going to use."</Em>

<P>Jeff Boles<br>
Taneja Group Inc.

<P> <Em>To get performance right, you've really got to understand the customer's needs. 
If you've got enough budget you can make things blazingly fast, but is it going to be
cost-effective?"</Em>

<P>Greg Schulz<br>
The Server and Storage I/O Group 

  <LI> <h5>Tiered Storage</h5>


<P> Most well-designed storage virtualization environments utilize a "tiered" 
architecture, in which frequently used data resides on fast SSDs or SAS drives and 
less regularly accessed records sit on slower but more economical SATA drives. The 
end result is an optimal blend of performance and cost-effectiveness.

  <LI> <h5>Caches</h5>

<P> Well-made storage virtualization systems keep the most heavily used applications 
and files in a separate repository called a cache. Typically built with solid-state 
memory chips or hard drives that execute read and write operations faster than 
spinning disks, caches can significantly accelerate a storage system's performance.

  <LI> <h5>Redundancy Technologies</h5>

<P> Many storage virtualization solutions rely on Redundant Array of Independent Disk 
(RAID) technology to protect data from loss due to mechanical failures. RAID systems
store identical copies of data on multiple hard drives, so that data remains available 
even if one or more of those drives crashes.

<P> RAID systems have a significant weakness, however: All of their hard drives 
typically reside on the same host server.  If that host machine breaks, applications 
could lose access to critical data. As a result, the latest virtual storage systems 
employ Redundant Array of Independent Node (RAIN) technology rather than RAID. RAIN 
systems disperse data not only across multiple disks, but across multiple servers as 
well. That keeps data continuously available even if several servers go down at once.

  <LI> <h5>Data Copying Technologies</h5>

<P> As powerful as they are, redundancy technologies like RAID and RAIN alone can't 
fully protect data in storage virtualization systems. Backing up data as well is 
essential.

<P> Sophisticated virtual storage implementations use two key technologies to 
streamline that task:</P> 

   <UL>
     <LI> Data mirroring: Storage virtualization solutions equipped with data mirroring 
          write data in two or more places simultaneously every time users save changes. 
          This creates an up-to-the-minute backup copy and minimizes data loss when 
          primary storage systems fail.

     <LI> Snapshots: A snapshot captures the complete contents of a storage system at 
          a given point in time. Snapshots enable companies to reset specific files and 
          databases or an entire storage environment to one of several earlier states 
          if data becomes corrupted.
   </UL>
</OL>

<h4>Sizing a Virtual Storage Environment</h4>

The first step in deploying a storage virtualization solution should be thoroughly 
analyzing your client's network infrastructure and then answering the following 
questions:

<OL>
  <LI> What applications will your customer be hosting on their private cloud and 
how much 
disk space do those applications consume? This will help you calculate the client's
storage capacity needs.

  <LI> What are the performance requirements of the customer's applications, in IOPS? 
       This will help you select appropriate disk arrays and design an effective 
       tiering strategy.

  <LI> How much downtime can your client tolerate? This will help you set their 
       "recovery time objective," or RTO.

  <LI> How many minutes' or hours' worth of information can your client afford to 
       lose in the event of a system failure or disaster? This will help you set 
       their "recovery point objective," or RPO.  
</OL>


<P> Collect as much hard, statistical data about your client's current needs as 
possible, using either their network management software or a remote monitoring and 
management solution. In addition, gather as much historical data about disk space and 
performance requirements as is available.  Comparing figures from a year ago to their 
present-day equivalents will help you more accurately gauge how quickly your customer's 
needs are growing, so you can provision their private cloud appropriately for its 
first six to 12 months of use without overcharging them for resources they're unlikely 
to require in the near term.

<h4>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Basics</h4>

<P> Though redundant by nature, storage virtualization solutions are as vulnerable to 
catastrophic hardware failure and natural disasters as any other storage environment. 
Furnishing them with complete and dependable disaster recovery and business continuity 
capabilities is therefore essential.

<OL>
  <LI> <h5>Disaster Recovery</h5>

<P> Disaster recovery technologies help companies meet their RPO targets by backing 
up data on a regular basis. Service providers should always make certain that the 
virtual storage environment supporting a private cloud does the following:

  <OL>
    <LI> Uses redundancy technologies such as RAIN and RAID to minimize exposure to 
         data loss.

    <LI> Continuously mirrors data locally in real time as changes occur.

    <LI> Continuously mirrors data to a secure, remote location as well. This process 
         should employ 256-bit AES encryption techniques to protect data both in transit 
         over the Internet and "at rest" offsite.

    <LI> Creates snapshots on a frequent and consistent basis.
  </OL>

  <LI> <h5>Business Continuity</h5>

<P> Simply having a backup copy of data somewhere won't restore companies to operational 
readiness if the device that data normally resides on has been damaged. Business 
continuity technologies help clients reach their RTO targets by getting them up and 
running again quickly after a hardware loss. For example, state-of-the-art private 
clouds have the ability to create a virtual image of a failed server that your 
customer can use until replacement hardware has been deployed.
</OL>

<h4>Managing a Virtual Storage Environment</h4>

<P> Though a well-designed private cloud makes extensive use of automation to lighten 
administrative burdens, disciplined management of its virtual storage infrastructure 
remains important just the same. In particular, be sure to perform these two tasks 
regularly:

   <UL>
     <LI> Monitor disk space consumption trends, to ensure you always add capacity 
          well before existing space runs out.

     <LI> Monitor performance for signs of deterioration. If a virtual storage 
          environment appears to be slowing down, you may need to modify its tiering 
          strategy or make greater use of faster SAS drives and SSDs.  

          <P>Of course, identifying capacity and performance patterns will be easier 
          if you have an initial set of figures to make comparisons with, so be sure 
          to capture baseline capacity and performance measurements before putting 
          your client's private cloud into production.
   </UL>

<P> <Em>Storage virtualization can be a great resource-pooling tool, but it can also 
give you visibility into the storage infrastructure that can help you make better 
decisions down the road."</Em>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<P> Many newcomers to private cloud computing have little experience with storage 
virtualization. Yet knowing how to configure and maintain an efficient virtual 
storage infrastructure is indispensable to deploying successful private cloud 
solutions.

<P> Becoming proficient in storage virtualization takes time, but mastering the 
concepts and techniques described in this white paper is a good way to get started. 
Over time, and with the benefit of hands-on experience, you'll be sure to acquire all 
of the know-how you need to fine-tune performance, minimize wasted disk space, and 
maximize storage system availability.

<p class="firstP"><i>With IT budgets expected to decrease 0.6% in 2012 in North America 
and data still growing in the <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/storage-networking-management/232601498?itc=nwc_trk_ts_inline">10% to 24% range</a>, 
storage virtualization has become a necessity, not a luxury.
</i></p>

<p><i>In the first of a two-part series, </i>Network Computing examines the various 
places within the IT infrastructure where storage virtualization can take place, 
including servers and disk arrays, and via physical and virtual appliances. 


<p> Virtualizing storage can increase disk utilization and administration flexibility, 
and improve disaster recovery and business continuity, notes Howard Marks, founder and 
chief scientist at DeepStorage.net, a storage and networking consultancy, and a frequent 
contributor to <i>Network Computing</i> and <i>InformationWeek</i>. From thin 
provisioning to replication to federation, virtualization options can make your storage 
more supple and responsive, and free you from vendor lock-in, he writes in a new 
<i>InformationWeek</i> report, <i>Strategy: Storage Virtualization Guide</i>.
</p>

<p> Storage virtualization is not new. According to the 
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/storage/systems/232600953" 
target="_blank"> 2012 InformationWeek State of Storage survey</a>, 31% of storage 
professionals use some kind of storage virtualization.  Marks says if we define 
storage virtualization as any technology that presents storage in a new configuration, 
then we've all been virtualizing storage for many years. 
</p>

<p> Many storage virtualization features that were once available in only dedicated 
storage virtualization products are now part of most disk arrays. Storage 
virtualization appliances are typically responsible for other tasks, such as 
heterogeneous replication and federation. These devices sit in-line in front of arrays 
and create a common interface for hosts, allowing administrators to mix and match the 
protocols and arrays that sit behind the appliances. 
</p>

<p> "There's no one aspect [of storage virtualization] that's most important," Marks 
says. "What ends up happening is an organization has a particular problem like 
migration or replication. They add the virtualization platform and then start using 
the other features. Or someone decides they like to decouple the management 
virtualization features from the back-end hardware to either have a single management 
interface or save money so they design an architecture with virtualization appliances 
or volume managers and dumb storage on the back end."			 	 
	</p>

<p class="firstP"> Storage virtualization was initially introduced via the volume 
manager, which allowed a user to slice and dice a hard drive into multiple volumes. 
Over time it evolved to include functions like RAID, thin provisioning and snapshots. 
Marks says most operating systems include volume managers that can create RAID sets 
and divide them into volumes. 
</p>

<p> The most common platform for external storage virtualization is the dedicated 
storage appliance, which sits in the SAN data path between host servers and storage 
arrays. Because data access passes through the appliance, most organizations will 
deploy appliances in redundant pairs or clusters so the failure of one appliance 
won&#8217;t cut off access to the storage system. 

<p> Storage vendors have developed software called virtual storage appliances (VSAs). 
These perform some of the same functions as physical appliances but are instead 
delivered as a virtual machine that runs on a hypervisor. Because many of the most 
interesting hypervisor features, such as live migration and high availability, require 
some sort of shared storage, VSAs make these features available to branch offices and
 SMB server rooms that can&#8217;t justify the cost and complexity of traditional SANs.
</p>

<p> Virtualizing storage in the array can bring the advantages of storage virtualization 
to the data center without the complication of additional appliances. Simplifying 
migration is one of the biggest reasons to implement storage virtualization, so the 
appliance approach, which can be used with any storage system, is probably more 
appropriate for most users.

	</h4>

<p class="firstP"> In the second of a two-part series on storage virtualization and 
based on a new InformationWeek report, <i>Strategy: Storage Virtualization Guide, 
Network Computing</i> takes a closer look at the pros and cons of the available storage 
virtualization options. Part 1, <a href="#ImportanceStorageVirt">The Importance Of 
Storage Virtualization</a>," examined the various places within the IT infrastructure 
where storage virtualization can take place, including servers and disk arrays, and 
via physical and virtual appliances.</p>

<p> One could assume that the dynamic duo of EMC and its majority-owned VMware, the 
leaders in storage and virtualization, respectively, would have an unfair advantage 
in storage virtualization. Not so, says Howard Marks, founder and chief scientist at 
DeepStorage.net, a storage and networking consultancy, and a frequent contributor to 
<i>Network Computing</i> and <i>InformationWeek</i>. 

<p> "Storage virtualization and server virtualization are separate, and EMC is more 
focused on building features into the storage platforms than in VPLEX," he states. 
"That said, VMware and the other hypervisor vendors are adding storage virtualization 
features to the hypervisors. Storage vMotion is, after all, automated migration, and 
VMware SRM's replication is hardware-agnostic." 
</p>

<p> Solid-state disks (SSDs) have started showing up in storage virtualization vendors' 
lineups to accelerate storage access. A number of vendors, including FalconStor NSS 
and NexentaStor, can use flash in the virtualization appliance as a cache, while others, 
like IBM's SAN Volume Controller (SVC) and DataCore's SANsymphony, will combine SSDs 
and disks to create storage pools with automated sub-LUN tiering between the SSD and 
disk.
</p>

<p> Storage federation, which is EMC's VPLEX claim to fame and available in IBM's SVC, 
extends the data protection aspect of data replication to turn a set of independent 
disk arrays into a single federated storage system across multiple data centers. 
Federation goes two steps further than the data protection provided by conventional 
replication, Marks says: It allows access to the volume at both the primary and 
secondary systems, and maintains the same volume identity across multiple systems.
 Virtual machines and the applications that run on top of them can be moved from site 
to site in a federation system. 
</p>

<p> Evolving from the popular Veritas Volume Manager, Symantec's Storage Foundation has 
added snapshots, thin provisioning, multipath management, SSD acceleration and just 
about any other storage management feature you can think of, notes Marks. VMware 
vSphere doesn't include a volume manager, per se, but many of its storage features, 
such as thin provisioning, solve the same problems as more traditional storage 
virtualization options.
</p>

<p> Dedicated storage appliances such as EMC's VPLEX, IBM's SVC and FalconStor's NSS 
combine storage virtualization software with industry-standard x86 servers. Marks says 
others, like NetApp's V-Series, use custom hardware, while DataCore's SANsymphony-V is 
a software product that runs on Windows Server.
</p>

<p> A more recent development is the introduction of the virtual storage appliance 
(VSA), software that performs some of the same functions as a physical appliance but 
is instead delivered as a virtual machine that runs on a hypervisor. Marks says there's 
a wide range of functionality in the VSAs available today--StarWind, Openfiler and 
NexentaStor are virtual server versions of the vendor's software that was originally 
designed to turn a physical server into iSCSI targets or unified storage systems. 
Others, like StorMagic and VMware VSA, were designed specifically for the hypervisor 
environment, while some, such as EMC and NetApp, have limited-use or 
limited-distribution VSAs that emulate their hardware storage systems.
</p>

<p> The bottom line, says Marks, is whether it's implemented as a dedicated appliance 
or as a feature of a storage array or hypervisor, storage virtualization can make 
both you and your storage system more efficient.  It can make your life easier through 
transparent migration and a consistent user interface across multiple storage systems. 
Or it can reduce the amount of extra storage you keep around just in case, by boosting 
your storage utilization through thin provisioning and snapshots.

<p>Managing multiple storage devices can be difficult and time-consuming, so many IT 
managers turn to <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.co.uk/feature/A-guide-to-storage-virtualization">storage
virtualization technology</a> for data storage management. Storage virtualization can 
hide the complexity of a storage-area network (SAN) by pooling together multiple storage 
devices so they look like they're just one storage device. Reducing the complexity of 
a SAN can often help IT administrators perform backup tasks more easily. Plus, 
<a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/guides/All-in-One-Buying-Guides">storage

infrastructure problems.</p>

<p>But despite the <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/feature/The-benefits-of-storage-virtualization">benefits
of storage virtualization</a>, many IT administrators are slow to implement the 
technology because the transition from a non-virtualized to a virtualized environment 
isn't always a smooth process.  Professional services are often needed to analyze 
vendor products and help IT managers with the complex transition.</p>

<a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/feature/Storage-virtualization-solutions-explained">(Source Origin)</a></h3>
<p><b>By Stephen J. Bigelow, Senior Technology Writer</b></p>

<p><i>This article is part of the 
<a href="http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/feature/Virtualization-technologies-explained">Virtualization
Explained</a> series. For more information, check out our related articles on 
<a href="http://searchsystemschannel.techtarget.com/feature/Server-virtualization-explained">server
virtualization</a> and

virtualization</a>.</i></p>

<p> Inefficient storage utilization and unnecessary storage purchases have led to the 
adoption of storage virtualization solutions, which use abstraction to separate physical 
disk space from the logical assignment of that space. Virtualization allows the storage 
available on multiple systems (often SAN storage subsystems) to be aggregated so that 
disk space forms a single logical resource.  The virtualized storage pool is then 
provisioned for use by users, servers and applications.</p>

<p> The basic premise of storage virtualization solutions is not new. Disk storage has 
long relied on partitioning to organize physical disk tracks and sectors into clusters, 
and then abstract clusters into logical drive partitions (e.g., the C: drive). This 
allows the operating system to read and write data to the local disks without regard to 
the physical location of individual bytes on the disk platters.</p>

<p>Virtualization brings efficiency to the storage environment. By pooling storage 
resources into a single resource, administrators can manage all of the space included 
in the pool regardless of its location. This allows for much better storage utilization, 
often reaching 80% or better. Storage management is also easier since virtualized 
storage can be managed from a single administrative console -- a storage administrator 
can see utilization trends and growth patterns more clearly and make better upgrade or 
capacity planning decisions. Virtualized storage can be thinly provisioned, or even 
dynamically provisioned (increasing or decreasing the size of a LUN) as needed.</p>


<p> Virtualized storage is also flexible. Once storage space is decoupled from a 
physical disk or storage array, it's simple to migrate and copy that virtual storage 
between systems or geographic locations. For example, a virtual LUN can be migrated 
from an older storage system to a newer one for better performance without making any 
adjustments to the application. Similarly, a virtual LUN can be copied to another local 
storage system for backup purposes, or replicated to an off-site storage location for 
disaster recovery purposes.</p>

<p>There are numerous elements involved in storage virtualization solutions. They can be
implemented within the storage array itself using products like the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hds.com/products/storage-systems/universal-storage-platform-v.html">Universal
Storage Platform V from Hitachi Data Systems (HDS)</a> or the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.equallogic.com/products/view.aspx?id=2819">EqualLogic
PS family from Dell</a>, or through dedicated appliances like the <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.lefthandnetworks.com/vsa.aspx">Virtual SAN Appliance (VSA) for VMware 
from LeftHand Networks</a>. There are also software-based storage virtualization 
products, such as the <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.datacore.com/products/prod_SANsymphony.asp">SANsymphony
software from DataCore Software</a>, <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software/invista.htm">Invista software from 
EMC Corp</a>. or the <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=virtualization">Veritas Virtual
Infrastructure from Symantec Corp</a>.. There are numerous other products available to 
implement storage virtualization -- each with its own unique features and pros and cons. 
Solution providers face the challenge of matching each customer's needs with the most 
suitable virtualization product.</p>

<p><b>What are the issues or limitations with storage virtualization?</b></p>

<p>Entry costs and learning curves are the first issues for smaller businesses. Client 
costs usually start with a network assessment and deployment of any appropriate network 
upgrades for the LAN (e.g., moving some elements of the LAN from 1 Gigabit Ethernet to 
10 GigE) or SAN. Higher storage utilization often means higher storage traffic from 
users and higher migration traffic between storage systems, so ensuring network 
readiness is always the first consideration for a solution provider.</p>

<p> Solution providers must also consider the interoperability of virtualization products
within the customer's storage environment. "If you have heterogeneous storage vendors 
in the mix, there's an ambition for everyone to support everyone else's equipment," said 
Keith Norbie, director of storage and virtualization at <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.nexusmn.com/">Nexus Information Systems</a> in Plymouth, Minn. 
"The question is, how well does that work?"</p>

<p> While there can be significant benefits to virtualizing a heterogeneous storage 
environment, Norbie cautions that it's not always possible. Often, solution providers 
face performance and support issues during a heterogeneous storage virtualization 
project. It may be necessary to avoid virtualization on some storage systems until a 
future technology refresh cycle allows the client to implement a more 
virtualization-friendly storage platform.</p>

<p> Once assessments and upgrades have been completed, costs then move to the deployment,
configuration and testing of storage virtualization products. Training should also be 
provided so that customers can work within the virtualized environment. Losing the 
relationship between data and physical storage can be disorienting, and customers need 
to understand how to use new storage management tools. Many solution providers ease 
their customers' entry into virtualization by deploying the technology in phases -- 
starting with a single storage system or application, refining the deployment and 
systematically extending the virtualization to other storage over
time.</p><!-- Begin Related Topics (earlier called Tags) include -->

<p>In 2012, 58% of installed x86 workloads are running in a VM. By 2015, 77% of installed x86

<p>ORLANDO, Fla. -- Server virtualization allows much higher rates of system usage, but the
resulting increases in network traffic pose significant challenges for enterprise storage. The
simple "single server, single network port" paradigm has largely been displaced by servers running
multiple workloads and using numerous network ports for communication, resiliency and storage
traffic.</p>

<p>Virtual workloads are also stressing storage for tasks, including desktop instances, backups,
disaster recovery (DR), and test and development.</p>


<p>At Gartner Symposium/ITxpo here this week, <a href="http://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=10016" target="_blank">Stanley Zaffos</a>, a
Gartner research vice president, outlined the implications of server virtualization on storage and
explained how <a href="http://searchvirtualstorage.techtarget.com/tutorial/Storage-virtualization-essentials-Cut-costs-and-increase-storage-efficiency">storage
virtualization solutions</a>, the right approach, and the proper tool set can help organizations
mitigate the impact on enterprise storage.</p>

<p><b>Consider using </b><a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/storage-virtualization"><b>storage
virtualization</b></a><b>.</b> Zaffos urges organizations to deploy storage virtualization as a
means of better storage practice, and he underscores core benefits of the technology:</p>

<ul>
<li>Storage virtualization supports storage consolidation/pooling, allowing all storage to be
"seen" and treated as a single resource. This avoids orphaned storage, improves storage utilization
and mitigates storage costs by reducing the need for new storage purchases. The benefits of storage
consolidation increase with the amount of storage being managed.</li>

<li>Storage virtualization supports agile and thin provisioning, allowing organizations to create
larger logical storage areas than the actual disk space allocated. This also reduces storage costs
because a business does not need to purchase all of the physical storage up front -- simply add
more storage as the allocated space fills up. Later tools may allow dynamic provisioning where the
logical volume size can be scaled up or down on demand. Management and capacity planning is
important here.</li>

<li>Storage virtualization supports <a href="http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/definition/QoS-Quality-of-Service">quality
of service</a> (QoS) features that enhance storage functions. For example, <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/podcast/Auto-tiering-an-important-technology-in-todays-storage-industry">auto-tiering</a>
can automatically move data from faster and more expensive storage to slower and less expensive
storage (and back) based on access patterns. Another feature is prioritization, where some data is
given I/O priority over other data.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Consider using solid-state drives (SSDs).</b> One of the gating issues for storage is the lag
time caused by mechanical delays that are unavoidable in conventional hard-disk technologies. This
limits storage performance, and the effects are exacerbated for virtual infrastructures where I/O
streams are randomly mixed together and funneled across the network to the storage array, creating
lots of disk activity. Storage architects often opt to create large disk groups. By including many
spindles in the same group, the mechanical delays are effectively spread out and minimized because
one disk is writing/reading a portion of the data while other disks are seeking. Zaffos points to
SSDs as a means of reducing spindle count and supplying much higher IOPS for storage tasks.</p>

<p><b>Plan the move to virtualization carefully.</b> Data center architects must develop a vision
of their infrastructure and operation as they embrace virtualization. Zaffos suggested IT
professionals start by identifying and quantifying the impact server virtualization, data growth
and the need for 24/7 operation will have on the storage infrastructure and services.</p>

<div class="aside extraInfo ">

<p>Next, determine what you actually need to accomplish and align storage services with the
operational abilities and physical infrastructure. For example, if you need to emphasize
backup/restoration capabilities, support data analytics, or handle desktop virtualization, it's
important to be sure that the infrastructure can support those needs. If not, you may need to
upgrade or make architectural changes to support those capabilities.</p>

<p>When making decisions for virtualization, Zaffos notes the difference between strategic and
tactical issues. Strategic decisions create lock-in, and tactical decisions yield short-term
benefits. For example, the move to thin provisioning is a tactical decision, but the choice to use
replication like SRDF would be a strategic decision.</p>

<p><b>Use available tools.</b> Storage virtualization benefits from tools that can optimize storage
activity. Zaffos points to examples including VMware <a href="http://searchvirtualstorage.techtarget.com/tip/vSphere-Storage-I-O-Control-What-it-does-and-how-to-configure-it">Storage
I/O Control</a> (SIOC) and <a href="http://searchvirtualstorage.techtarget.com/definition/vStorage-APIs-for-Array-Integration-VAAI">vStorage
APIs for Array Integration</a> (VAAI). SIOC essentially provides storage administrators with I/O
and bandwidth throttling, along with I/O prioritization. This allows administrators to allocate
resources to high-priority workloads and minimize the effects of other I/O-heavy (but less
critical) workloads. By comparison, VAAI allows storage developers to integrate array products with
vSphere, enabling features like full copy, block zeroing and hardware-assisted locking.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Zaffos notes that storage virtualization solutions can be a key enabling technology
for server and desktop virtualization -- both of which place extreme demands on the storage
infrastructure. But, he said, the move to storage virtualization takes a thorough understanding of
the benefits, careful planning to ensure proper alignment with business and technical needs, and
judicious use of storage technologies like tiers and SSD.</p><!-- Begin Related Topics (earlier called Tags) include -->

<P> Data center consolidation and cost reduction have driven the steady adoption of 
virtual server technologies in enterprise data storage environments. The major 
players (Microsoft, VMware and Xen) all provide support for using direct-attached 
storage (DAS), network-attached storage (NAS) or storage area networks (SANs). This 
article provides tips on how to decide which data storage technology is best for 
your virtual environment: DAS, NAS, or SAN, and the pros and cons of each.

<h4>Direct-attached storage</h4>

<p>Direct-attached storage can be deployed in a number of forms; it could be disks 
deployed directly in the server chassis or as an external storage enclosure plugging 
directly into a SCSI/SAS card on the server's internal bus. Either way, DAS has the 
following pros and cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>DAS is less expensive than NAS and SAN</b>. If plugged directly into the 
    server, the cost may be as simple as purchasing hard drives, which today have a 
    capacity of up to 2 TB.</li>

  <li><b>DAS is not shareable.</b> By definition, DAS is dedicated to the server 
    that it's connected to. Because of this, the resources can't easily be shared 
    with another server, especially if hard drives plug directly into the server 
    chassis. Limited sharing may represent a serious drawback in larger virtual server 
    deployments where physical servers are "clustered" to the storage in order to
    provide local resiliency through features such as VMware's VMotion, which doesn't 
    work unless storage is sharable.</li>

  <li><b>DAS is not scalable.</b> Scalability is restricted in several areas. First, 
    the enclosure itself will usually be limited in size and therefore in storage 
    capacity. Second, connectivity into the server will be limited by the number of 
    expansion slots available to accommodate SCSI and SAS cards.</li>

  <li><b>DAS does not have the performance of NAS and SAN solutions.</b> Performance 
    is a significant factor in delivering a high throughput virtual server 
    environment.</li>

  <li><b>DAS doesn't offer advanced features like remote replication and snapshots.</b> 
    Keep in mind, however, that while these features are good to have, they may not be 
    necessary in your virtual environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>So when is direct-attached storage a better solution than a storage area network 
or network-attached storage? Clearly if cost is an issue, DAS offers the best price 
point. You should also consider DAS if advanced features such as remote replication 
or high performance/scalability aren't required in your virtual environment. For 
example, DAS combined with an internal RAID card used in a branch location where only 
one physical server is deployed, would be a great solution.</p>

<h4>Network-attached storage</h4>

<p>Networked-attached storage provides connectivity to the virtual server through a 
TCP/IP connection and storage access is provided at the file level. NAS pros and cons 
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>NAS is shareable.</b> Resources may be shared by multiple ESX deployments. 
    This is a key benefit when using clustered virtual environments and features such 
    as VMotion.</li>

  <li><b>NAS is scalable in terms of capacity and performance.</b> For larger virtual 
    deployments, performance becomes a big issue. The concentration of I/O into a 
    small number of LUNs can potentially result in throughput bottlenecks. This is 
    especially likely with advanced features of NAS.</li>

  <li><b>NAS provides advanced features such as thin provisioning, replication and 
      snapshots.</b> For many virtual environments, these features are particularly 
      beneficial. Thin provisioning can be used to limit the amount of real storage 
      provided to virtual hosts, which will not use all of the storage they are 
      presented with. Snapshots allow virtual machine images to be captured for data
      backup or used for cloning, where multiple virtual images are created from a 
      single "gold master" image. The combination of thin provisioning and snapshots 
      offers the opportunity to create hundreds of virtual machines for very little 
      storage cost. This is an extremely efficient provisioning method for development 
      or on-demand environments.</li>

  <li><b>NAS abstracts storage management from the server.</b> This means the virtual 
      machine images can be managed (and subsequently backed up) as a file system.</li>

  <li><b>NAS can be costly.</b> Despite the cost, the range of NAS devices on the 
      market is extremely wide -- from small four-disk devices to multi-petabyte 
      hardware configurations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage area networks in a virtual environment</h4>

<p>Storage area networks provide connectivity to the virtual server using either the 
Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI protocols. SAN storage has the following pros and cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>SAN storage is sharable.</b> Resources may be easily shared between multiple 
      virtual server hardware devices. This is important in clustered virtual server 
      environments.</li>

  <li><b>SANs are highly scalable, both from a capacity and performance perspective.</b> 
      For large deployments of virtual servers, scalability is extremely important and 
      the whole premise of SAN is to provide high levels of scale.</li>

  <li><b>SAN storage provides synchronous replication.</b> Synchronous replication 
      isn't typically available on NAS implementations, and for many environments, 
      this may be a key requirement for a disaster recovery strategy.</li>

  <li><b>SAN environments are highly resilient.</b> SAN environments are well equipped 
      with dual fabrics, HBAs and highly available storage arrays.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What type of storage best fits your virtual environment?</h4>

<p>Everyone has different needs and requirements for their virtual environments. 
Choose DAS if cost is an issue, your virtual environment is small and if your 
environment doesn't require advanced features like data replication. Choose NAS or 
SAN if you are building large-scale virtual environments. NAS is the better option 
if you require the ability to clone large numbers of virtual hosts. However, SAN will 
be a better fit if you require the highest levels of availability and resiliency. 
Whichever platform you choose, we can expect virtual servers to form a major part of
all IT deployments in the future.</p>


<a name="SANStorage"></a><h3>Storage architecture choices: SANs 
<a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/feature/Storage-architecture-choices-SANs">(Source Origin)</a></h3>
</div>
<b>By Yuval Shavit, Features Writer</b><p></p>

<p><a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/resources/Storage-Area-Network-SAN">Storage area networks (SANs)</a>,
 which were once available only to large enterprises that could afford 
to pay steep premiums for the best storage, are increasingly moving 
downstream. SANs combine the benefits of shared storage with those of <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/direct-attached-storage">direct-attached storage (DAS)</a>,
 and newer technologies make them affordable even for small businesses. 
This article will explore why storage area network (SAN) devices may be 
right for your clients.</p>

<h4>Storage acronyms: SAN, NAS and DAS</h4>

<p>The three main ways of connecting storage to servers are SANs, <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/resources/Network-Attached-Storage-NAS">network-attached storage (NAS)</a>
 and DAS. With DAS, which is the most basic form of the three, the drive
 connects directly to the server and is often even in the same 
enclosure. Because DAS is simple to install and requires no large, 
IT-level planning, it's still what many small businesses rely on, said 
Paul Franco, executive vice president at <a href="http://www.zibiz.com/" target="_blank">Zibiz Data Management</a>, a storage consultancy in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.</p>

<p>SANs and NAS both separate data storage from servers, allowing 
servers to share those resources. NAS devices have their own file 
system, so they work best as file servers. SANs give block-level access 
and appear to computers as normal drives, so they work better for 
applications such as databases. Companies start needing databases once 
they reach about 100 users, which is why even small businesses are 
starting to look into storage area networks, Franco said. SANs are often
 faster than NAS systems, too.</p>

<h4>Benefits of SANs</h4>

<p>Why storage area networks? Depending on how many servers your client 
has, a SAN can offer significant advantages over a DAS array for each 
server. Consolidating storage devices will save your clients money by 
allowing them to buy capacity according to what the entire company 
needs, as opposed to having each server work with its own disk array, 
much of which may go unused. Provisioning tools can let your client 
dynamically allocate space -- instead of giving a server 10 GB in 
anticipation of growth in five years, an IT manager can give it 2 or 3 
GB and increase that as needed, Franco said.</p>

</tr>
</tbody></table>

<!-- CONTENT COMPONENT :47779-->
<p>Because SANs can consist of several physically separate drives or 
arrays, they also offer replication and disaster recovery features. For 
instance, you can set up two SANs with automatic, real-time replication.
 If the primary SAN goes down for any reason, the system will 
automatically fail over to the second.</p>

<p>SANs also complement <a href="http://searchsystemschannel.techtarget.com/feature/Channel-Explained-Virtualization">server virtualization</a>.
 One of the features of some virtualization software is the ability to 
move images between physical servers on the fly, without downtime. This 
requires the two servers to share the same storage device -- both so 
they can access the same data and to serve as a medium for the <a href="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-machine">virtual machine</a> (VM) image.</p>

<h4>Cost of SANs</h4>

<p>A traditional SAN works on a <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/resources/Fibre-Channel-Storage-Area-Network-SAN">Fibre Channel (FC)</a>
 network. The wires may be either fiber-optic or copper, but since even 
the copper FC wires are different than Ethernet cables, all FC-connected
 SANs require a separate, dedicated network.</p>

<p>Fibre Channel equipment is expensive; the wires, which are often 
optical, can cost $100 to $200 each, and each server's FC adapter will 
cost another $400 to $1,000, said <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/news/1284189/iSCSI-SANs-Benefits-challenges-and-reseller-opportunities">Henry Baltazar</a>, storage analyst for <a href="http://www.the451group.com/" target="_blank">The 451 Group</a>
 in San Francisco. This extra infrastructure makes up the bulk of the 
cost for SANs that use FC, which is why storage area networks have 
traditionally been reserved for larger companies while smaller companies
 have had to go sans SANs.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/resources/iSCSI-SAN-IP-Storage">iSCSI</a>,
 a variant on the SCSI interface that runs over IP, can eliminate those 
costs by connecting your SAN devices over your existing LAN. Your client
 will still need to make a few adjustments, such as configuring a <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-LAN">virtual LAN (VLAN)</a>
 for the SAN drives to ensure that they get all the bandwidth they need;
 your role should include helping the client with this implementation 
work. An entry-level iSCSI-attached SAN can cost as little as $10,000 
and are typically easy enough to self-configure, Franco said.</p>

<p><a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/resources/Storage-Area-Network-SAN">Storage area networks (SANs)</a>
let several servers share storage resources and are often used in situations that 
require high performance or shared storage with block-level access, like virtualized 
servers and clustered databases.  Although SANs started out as a high-end technology 
used only in large enterprises, cheaper SANs are now affordable even for small and 
medium-sized businesses (SMBs). In earlier installments of this Hot Spot  Tutorial, 
we examined <a href="#SANStorage">what benefits SANs offer</a> 
over other storage architectural choices, as well as the two main storage networking 
protocols, <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/feature/Fibre-Channel-and-iSCSI-Dueling-storage-networking-protocols">Fibre Channel and iSCSI</a>.  
In this installment, we'll look at the main considerations you should keep in mind when 
putting together a storage area network design.</p>

<h4>Uptime and availability</h4>

<p>Because several servers will rely on a SAN for all of their data, it's important 
to make the system very reliable and eliminate any single points of failure, said 
Paul Franco, executive vice president at <a href="http://www.zibiz.com/" 
target="_blank">Zibiz Data Management</a>, a Ronkonkoma, N.Y., storage consultancy. 
Most SAN hardware vendors offer redundancy within each unit -- like dual power 
supplies, internal controllers and emergency batteries -- but you should make sure 
that redundancy extends all the way to the server, Franco said.</p>

<a name="IPRedundancy"></a><p>In a typical storage area network design, each storage 
device connects to a switch that then connects to the servers that need to access 
the data. To make sure this path isn't a point of failure, your client should buy two 
switches for the SAN network. 
Each storage unit should connect to both switches, as should each server. If either 
path fails, software can fail over to the other. Some programs will handle that 
failover automatically, but cheaper software may require you to enable the failover 
manually, Franco said. You can also configure the program to use both paths if they're 
available, for load balancing.</p>

<p>But you should also consider how the drives themselves are configured, Franco said. 
RAID technology spreads data among several disks -- a technique called 
<a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/disk-striping" 
target="newwindow">striping</a> -- and can add 
<a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/parity" 
target="newwindow">parity</a> checks so that if any one disk fails, its content can 
be rebuilt from the others. There are several types of RAID, but the most common in 
SAN designs are levels 5, 6 and 1+0, Franco said.</p>



<!-- CONTENT COMPONENT :48656-->
<p>RAID 5 stripes data across every disk in the unit except one, which 
is used to store parity information that can be used to rebuild any 
drive that needs to be replaced. RAID 6 adds a second disk for redundant
 parity. This protects your client's data in case a second drive breaks 
during the first disk's rebuild, which can take up to 24 hours for a 
terabyte, Franco said. RAID 1+0 stripes data across a series of disks 
without any parity checks, which is very fast, but mirrors each of those
 disks to a second set of striped disks for redundancy.</p>

<h4>Capacity and scalability</h4>

<p>A good storage area network design should not only accommodate your 
client's current storage needs, but it should also be scalable so that 
your client can upgrade the SAN as needed throughout the expected 
lifespan of the system. You should consider how scalable the SAN is in 
terms of storage capacity, number of devices it supports and speed, said
 Greg Schulz, founder and senior analyst with <a href="http://www.storageio.com/" target="_blank">The StorageIO Group</a>, a Stillwater, Minn., consulting firm.</p>

<p>Because a SAN's switch connects storage devices on one side and 
servers on the other, its number of ports can affect both storage 
capacity and speed, Schulz said. By allowing enough ports to support 
multiple, simultaneous connections to each server, switches can multiply
 the bandwidth to servers. On the storage device side, you should make 
sure you have enough ports for redundant connections to existing storage
 units, as well as units your client may want to add later.</p>

<p>One feature of storage area network design that you should consider is <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/tip/How-thin-provisioning-improves-virtual-machine-performance">thin provisioning</a> of storage. Thin provisioning tricks servers into thinking a given volume within a SAN, known as a <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/logical-unit-number">logical unit number (LUN)</a>,
 has more space than it physically does. For instance, an operating 
system (OS) that connects to a given LUN may think the LUN is 2 TB, even
 though you have only allocated 250 GB of physical storage for it, 
Schulz said.</p>

<p>Thin provisioning allows you to plan for future growth without your 
client having to buy all of its expected storage hardware up front. In a
 typical "fat provisioning" model, each LUN's capacity corresponds to 
physical storage. That means that your client will have to buy as much 
space as it anticipates needing for the next few years, Schulz said. 
While it's possible to allocate a smaller amount of space for now and 
transfer its data to a larger provision as needed, that process is slow 
and could result in downtime for your client.</p>

<p>Thin provisioning allows you to essentially overbook a SAN's storage,
 promising a total capacity to the LUNs that is greater than the SAN 
physically has. As those LUNs fill up and start to reach the system's 
physical capacity, you can add more units to the SAN -- often in a 
hot-swappable way, Franco said. But because this approach to storage 
area network design requires more maintenance down the road, it's best 
for stable environments where a client can fairly accurately predict how
 each LUN's storage needs will grow, Schulz said.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>With several servers able to share the same physical hardware, it 
should be no surprise that security plays an important role in a storage
 area network design. Your client will want to know that servers can 
only access data if they're specifically allowed to. If your client is 
using <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/resources/iSCSI-SAN-IP-Storage">iSCSI</a>,
 which runs on a standard Ethernet network, it's also crucial to make 
sure outside parties won't be able to hack into the network and have raw
 access to the SAN.</p>

<p>Most of this security work is done at the SAN's switch level, Franco said. <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/zoning">Zoning</a>
 allows you to give only specific servers access to certain LUNs, much 
as a firewall allows communication on specific ports for a given IP 
address. If any outward-facing application needs to access the SAN, like
 a website, you should configure the switch so that only that server's 
IP address can access it, Franco said.</p>

<p>If your client is using <a href="http://searchsystemschannel.techtarget.com/feature/Channel-Explained-Virtualization">virtual servers</a>, the storage area network design will also need to make sure that each <a href="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-machine">virtual machine (VM)</a>
 has access only to its LUNs, Schulz said. Virtualization complicates 
SAN security because you cannot limit access to LUNs by physical 
controllers anymore -- a given controller on a physical server may now 
be working for several VMs, each with its own permissions. To restrict 
each server to only its LUNs, set up a virtual adapter for each virtual 
server. This will let your physical adapter present itself as a 
different adapter for each VM, with access to only those LUNs that the 
virtualized server should see.</p>

<h4>Replication and disaster recovery</h4>

<p>With so much data stored on a SAN, your client will likely want you 
to build disaster recovery into the system. SANs can be set up to 
automatically mirror data to another site, which could be a failsafe SAN
 a few meters away or a <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/resources/Disaster-Recovery-and-Business-Continuity">disaster recovery (DR)</a> site hundreds or thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>If your client wants to build <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/mirror">mirroring</a>
 into the storage area network design, one of the first considerations 
is whether to replicate synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous 
mirroring means that as data is written to the primary SAN, each change 
is sent to the secondary and must be acknowledged before the next write 
can happen.</p>

<p>While this ensures that both SANs are true mirrors, synchronization 
introduces a bottleneck. If the secondary site has a latency as high as 
even 100 to 200 milliseconds (msec), your system will slow down as the 
primary SAN has to wait for each confirmation, Schulz said. Although 
there are other factors, latency is often related to distance; 
synchronous replication is generally possible up to about 6 miles, 
Franco said.</p>

<p>The alternative is to asynchronously mirror changes to the secondary 
site. You can configure this replication to happen as quickly as every 
second, or every few minutes or hours, Schulz said. While this means 
that your client could permanently lose some data, if the primary SAN 
goes down before it has a chance to copy its data to the secondary, your
 client should make <a href="http://searchstoragechannel.techtarget.com/feature/Weigh-your-backup-and-DR-technology-options">calculations based on its recovery point objective (RPO)</a> to determine how often it needs to mirror. </p><!-- Begin Related Topics (earlier called Tags) include -->
