<P><a href="http://www.openflow.org/wp/learnmore/">OpenFlow</a> promised a way out 
of the tyranny in a world dominated by proprietary networking vendors like Cisco, 
Juniper, Alcatel and others.  It offered the promise of traffic engineering using 
low-cost hardware and a way to design your network in a deterministic fashion rather 
than have to over-provision everything for the worst case scenario.  In jargon-speak 
OpenFlow  allows "separation of the control plane from the data plane."</p>
<p>What this means to you and me is that we can now take functions like access control 
lists (ACL) that were handled by the routers/switches and move that intelligence into 
Java software running in a virtual machine.  To do all these wonderful things all you 
need is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OpenFlow controller</li>
  <li>OpenFlow enabled switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Vendors who make OpenFlow compliant switches include Brocade, HP, Juniper, Dell, 
Extreme Networks, Arista and IBM.  Carriers who deploy OpenFlow in their networks 
today include <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/verizon-shows-off-openflows-benefits-for-carriers/">Verizon</a>.</p>
<p>Software Defined Networking (SDN) is the latest buzzword which sends shivers down 
the spines of the big router/switch vendors who made billions of dollars selling 
proprietary firmware based routers and switches.  The stifling world they thrust upon 
us of access routers, aggregation routers, layer 3 routers and WAN routers, millions 
of lines of code for each router, roadmaps that stretch into the next 10 years -  may 
all become a thing of the past thanks to the unrelenting march of technologies like 
SDN.</p>
<p>How do you visualize SDN?  Think of this new architecture as being modular and 
neatly layered like an IKEA shelf, with the data-plane layer at the bottom, control 
plane above it and the application plane on top:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The data-plane layer switches can be of two types: OpenFlow Hypervisor switches 
      and OpenFlow physical switches.</li>
  <li>The control plane could feature commercially available controllers like Big 
      Switch "Big network controller".</li>
  <li>The application plane is where you would have SDN applications, cloud 
      orchestration and other business applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players in the emerging SDN space include vendors like Nicira and Big Switch 
   Networks.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://nicira.com/">Nicira</a> who made available via open source 
      their <i>vSwitch Open vSwitch</i></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bigswitch.com/">Big Switch Networks</a> who made available 
      via open source their OpenFlow controller 
<a href="http://www.bigswitch.com/blog/2012/01/11/announcing-floodlight-an-open-source-openflow-controller">"Floodlight"</a> under the Apache 2 license.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.midokura.com/">Midokura</a> who virtualize the network stack 
      of OpenFlow with their MidoNet</li>
</ul>
<p>So what did the legacy networking and virtualization vendors do?  As the adage goes 
   - If you can't build it in-house then at least acquire it so you regain some nominal 
   measure of control.  This scenario was acted out recently when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VMware acquired Nicira for $1.2B</li>
  <li>Brocade acquired Vyatta for an undisclosed amount</li>
  <li>Cisco acquired Cloupia for $125M and Meraki for $1.2B</li>
</ul>
<p>That's enough about the vendors in the space.   If I am a user how do I benefit 
   from SDN?</p>
<p>Benefits of SDN to enterprise customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to squeeze more VMs into you existing rack servers results in 
      driving down your power and cooling costs.  This  in turn mean more CapEx savings 
      and OpEX savings (due to fewer trouble tickets) especially in an enterprise cloud 
      environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fidelity and Goldman Sachs are rumored to be customers of Big Switch Networks.</p>
<p>Benefits of SDN to cloud service providers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A way to virtualize your network
  <ul>
    <li>If you are benefiting from virtualizing servers using VMware or
 Citrix technology why stop there?  Why not go down a level 
and virtualize the underlying network of proprietary switches and 
routers and treat them like an un-differentiated pool of resources?</li>
    <li>A programmatic way to control your infrastructure:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are a telecom service provider you now have a way to move 
away from the proprietary architectures of Cisco, Juniper, Alcatel which
 requires a vendor's programmer to program your routers.  You can 
now have your own telecom engineers do the 
programming blissfully oblivious to the make/model of the 
underlying router.</li>
      <li>Better orchestration of cloud services.
      <ul>
        <li>Rapid provisioning including scale-up and scale-down.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In the service provider market these can quickly become key business differentiators. 
   Cloud providers like Amazon, Google, Facebook, MSN, Yahoo, Rackspace take advantage 
   of the benefits of SDN today.  Traditional services providers like 
   <a href="http://www.nttdata.com/global/en/news-center/global/2012/060801.html">NTT 
   are also adopters of SDN</a>.</p>
<p>If you are still with me you might wonder: I get all this OpenFlow, SDN business but 
   what pray tell does all this have to do with Hadoop and big data?  For starters, 
   Infoblox has proven that Hadoop performance can be accelerated using OpenFlow 
   enabled Ethernet switches instead of using pricier InfiniBand or other interconnects. 
   As <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/sdn-blog/soft-switch-erlang-stu-bailey-infoblox/2012/08/">Stuart Bailey, CTO of Infoblox</a>
   says "Imagine a single programmer routinely having 10,000 cores and their associated 
   networks to write Big Data applications!  SDN enables new industrial applications 
   like Big Data analysis in the same way the PC brought spreadsheets and word 
   processors into the enterprise."</p>
<p>If you wish to explore this area further look into 
<a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/%7Eeugeneng/papers/HotSDN12.pdf">papers like these 
from IBM on how you can program your network at run-time for big data applications</a>. 
To learn more about <a href="http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/business/large-business/en/Documents/Dell-Networking-SDN-POV.pdf">SDN itself 
look into papers like this one from Dell</a>.  If you happen to be an HP shop you'll 
want to catch up on HP's solutions for SDN  <a href="#HpSdnSolu">I</a>  and 
<a href="#HpVirNetSolu">II</a>.  So you see in the end big data has tangible benefits 
from this move towards SDN regardless of who makes your underlying network hardware.</p>

 By: Mark Leary Posted: Oct. 10, 2012</div>
<p><img src="http://cdn.sdncentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/HP-Throws-Down-the-Gauntlet.jpg"></p>
<p>Because our industry is full of naysayers, let's do a preemptive strike on the 
negatives. Is <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/listings/hp" target="_blank">HP's</a> 
new SDN solution available now? No. It is in beta and will not likely be ready for 
general release until mid-next year. Will HP's SDN solution work with all HP 
networking devices? No. Twenty-three 
<a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/listings/open-networking-foundation" 
target="_blank">OpenFlow</a>-enabled HP switch models are included. Will HP's SDN 
solution include networking devices from other vendors? No. Testing will focus on 
the now 23 HP <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/listings/open-networking-foundation">OpenFlow</a>-enabled 
devices. (Note: In all fairness to HP, OpenFlow-enabled devices are few and far between 
in production networks. Don't blame HP for not looking for needles in haystacks.) Has 
HP got this SDN thing all figured out with respect to performance... and reliability... 
and security... and interoperability... and manageability... and all those other things 
that make our networks whole? No. But then again, who has? And isn't that what beta 
testing is all about? Is HP providing a wealth of killer SDN apps as part of its new 
solution? No. Announced are three diverse and potentially high-impact apps. As for more 
apps... Stay tuned. The beta will absorb and prove out others as they come - and come 
they will.</p>
<p>So what's the big deal about HP's SDN announcements this week? Here's a quick Top 
5 list from my view:</p>
<p>1.  They involve real products operating in real networks. With a no-charge software 
update, in-place HP switches can be migrated to this new SDN model. Update the switch 
software and install HP's SDN controller and you have a functioning SDN environment - 
no programs to write, no wholesale swap-outs to make, no third party dependencies.</p>
<p>2.  They enable incremental adoption. HP's new SDN solution can be deployed as an 
"SDN Island" in a sea of traditional non-SDN networking segments and devices.  You want 
to try out SDN without a complete network overhaul? Go ahead. Apply it in your data 
center... or your campus... or your private cloud. Network advancements offered in 
manageable increments are always a good thing.</p>
<p>3.  They involve both HP and third party applications. HP isn't just throwing out 
its controller and <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/sdn-blog/new-sdncentral-resource-sdn-apis-and-sdn-sdks/2012/10/" 
target="_blank">APIs </a> and hoping people work  together to strengthen enforcement 
and speed reaction. Another app comes from CERN and focuses on load balancing. In 
essence, it offers load balancing for load balancers - an important function in this 
day of Big Data where east-west traffic is creating far more problems in data centers 
than north-south end user exchanges.</p>
<p>4.  They include both product AND SDN-focused support services. In the early stages 
of adoption, SDN success will hinge as much on process as it does product. SDN 
introduces new technologies, new design considerations, new management responsibilities, 
and yes, even new problems. Suppliers that make it easy to understand, conceive, deploy, 
and tune their respective SDN solution will not only drive success for themselves, but 
also the SDN movement overall. Here, HP is offering pre- and post-deployment services 
(e.g., staff training, baseline evaluations, and network optimization) that will give 
its solution the best chance to deliver on its promise.</p>
<p>5.  The heart of HP's new SDN solution - Virtual Application Networks SDN Controller 
- provides for some nice configuration flexibility. This is a must for SDN environments. 
Just as no two networks look alike, no two SDNs will look alike either. The controller 
is available as a software package and as a software/hardware system. Given this, you 
can surmise that the controller hardware is a rather straightforward server design. At 
least, for now. who knows what future SDN requirements hold in store for controller 
design? For high availability configurations, multiple controllload an be used in an 
active-active state, load sharing in normal circumstances and failing over when bad 
things happen. In addition, HP's SDN controller can take on multiple application 
personalities simultaneously. While the betas will aid capacity analysis in this 
scenario, the ability to readily serve new applications as needs arise - and as 
applications roll out - will be very beneficial to the operator looking to do more and 
more with their SDN.</p>
<p>For all those hoping for the best from SDN solutions and suppliers, feel free to 
add to the list. And for you naysayers, we can always do with a few more criticisms. 
The SDN movement is the better off for it, quite frankly. Just beware if you're an 
SDN supplier looking to throw stones at HP. People in glass houses...</p>
