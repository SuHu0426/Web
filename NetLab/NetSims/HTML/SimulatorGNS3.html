<h5><strong>Installing GNS3 Network Simulator.</strong></h5>

<p><img src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gns3-network-simulator-install_featured-image.jpg" alt="GNS3 Network Simulator Installation"></p>

<p>There are two main ways that GNS3 can be
 installed, either by using the all-in-one installer or by using one of 
the standalone packages. The standalone packages are not installers but 
simply an archive that can be extracted and run directly; this is a very
 useful option for those who do not want to run through the installation
 process. The option that will be covered in this article is the 
installer which includes the installation of Dynamips, Qemu/Pemu, Putty,
 VPCS, WinPcap and Wireshark.</p>

<h4>GNS3 Installation</h4>

<p>The installation of GNS3 is simple and 
the different options to select are based on the specific configuration 
of the target machine. The installation shown in this article will 
install all required programs and assumes nothing has been previously 
installed.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to obtain the GNS3 installer available at <a href="http://www.gns3.net/download/">http://www.gns3.net/download/</a>. Once this file is downloaded, click on the executable file as shown in Figure 1:</p>

<p>Once the installer has been launched, the screen shown in Figure 2 will be displayed; once at this screen press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="Click on the GNS3 Installation Executable" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-1.jpg" alt="Click on the GNS3 Installation Executable"></p>

<p>The next screen will display the license information to install GNS3 
and its associated programs.  If the terms are agreeable press the I
 Agree button.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img title="GNS3 License Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-3.jpg" alt="GNS3 License Screen"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
select a Start Menu folder name to insert the associated GNS3 shortcuts 
into; most people just leave this at the default of GNS3.  Once a 
name has been selected you will press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="Start Menu Name Selection" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-4.jpg" alt="Start Menu Name Selection"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
customize the installation by selecting which components will be 
installed; select the components that are required for the specific 
installation and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="GNS3 Component Selection" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-5.jpg" alt="GNS3 Component Selection"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
select where the GNS3 programs and most of its components will be 
installed. Select the appropriate path and press the Install button.</p>

<p><img title="GNS3 Install Location" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-6.jpg" alt="GNS3 Install Location"></p>

<p>If WinPcap was selected to be installed,
 the next few screens will be shown as the WinPcap installer is 
completed.  Once this screen is shown, press the Next button. If 
WinPcap was not selected move to Figure 11.</p>

<p><img title="WinPcap Installer Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-7.jpg" alt="WinPcap Installer Screen"></p>

<p>Read the next screen and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="WinPcap Installer Setup Wizard Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-8.jpg" alt="WinPcap Installer Setup Wizard Screen"></p>

<p>The next screen will display the license
 information to install WinPcap.  If the terms are agreeable press 
the I Agree button.</p>

<p><img title="WinPcap License Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-9.jpg" alt="WinPcap License Screen"></p>

<p>On the next screen select whether the WinPcap driver will be automatically started at boot. This is typical.</p>

<p><img title="WinPcap Driver on Startup" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-10.jpg" alt="WinPcap Driver on Startup"></p>

<p>Once the installer has finished it will display the final screen shown in Figure 11, press the Finish button.</p>

<p><img title="WinPcap Installer Finish" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-11.jpg" alt="WinPcap Installer Finish"></p>

<p>If Wireshark was selected to be 
installed, the next few screens will be shown as the Wireshark installer
 is completed; once this screen is shown press the Next button. If 
Wireshark was not selected move to Figure 21.</p>

<p><img title="Wireshark Installer Setup Wizard Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-12.jpg" alt="Wireshark Installer Setup Wizard Screen"></p>

<p>The next screen will display the license
 information to install Wireshark.  If the terms are agreeable 
press the I Agree button.</p>

<p><img title="Wireshark License Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-13.jpg" alt="Wireshark License Screen"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
customize the installation by selecting which components will be 
installed; select the components that are required for the specific 
installation and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="Wireshark Component Selection" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-14.jpg" alt="Wireshark Component Selection"></p>

<p>The next screen will ask which shortcuts
 to install as part of the Wireshark installation and ask if a number of
 different file associations should be associated to Wireshark. Select 
the wanted options and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="Wireshark Additional Tasks" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-15.jpg" alt="Wireshark Additional Tasks"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
select where Wireshark will be installed. Select the appropriate path 
and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="Wireshark Install Location" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/figure-16.jpg" alt="Wireshark Install Location"></p>

<p>The next screen will ask if WinPcap 
should be installed as well.  Since WinPcap was probably already 
installed first by the GNS3 installer, this option will probably not be 
selected; once done press the Install button.</p>

<p><img title="Install WinPCap (Wireshark Installer)" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-17.jpg" alt="Install WinPCap (Wireshark Installer)"></p>

<p>At this point the Wireshark installer will start as shown in Figure 17.</p>

<p><img title="Wireshark Installing" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-18.jpg" alt="Wireshark Installing"></p>

<p>Once the Wireshark installation is complete the screen shown in Figure 18 will be displayed; once done press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="Wireshark Installation Complete" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-19.jpg" alt="Wireshark Installation Complete"></p>

<p>At the next screen <strong>don't</strong> select the Run Wireshark option (this is because the GNS3 installer is still running) and press the Finish button.</p>

<p><img title="Completing the Wireshark Installation" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-20.jpg" alt="Completing the Wireshark Installation"></p>

<p>The next screen will show that the installation of GNS3 is proceeding.</p>

<p><img title="GNS3 Installation Proceeding" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-21.jpg" alt="GNS3 Installation Proceeding"></p>

<p>Once the GNS3 installation is complete the screen shown in Figure 21 will be displayed; once done press the Next button.</p>

<p><img title="GNS3 Installation Complete" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-22.jpg" alt="GNS3 Installation Complete"></p>

<p>The last screen in the installation process is shown in Figure 22; at this screen it is possible to run GNS3 for the first time.</p>

<p><img title="GNS3 Setup Complete" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-23.jpg" alt="GNS3 Setup Complete"></p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Once the installation is complete, the 
user has the ability to use all of the GNS3 capabilities. A couple of 
other articles will be written as a follow-up to display the way that 
these different capabilities can be used to help in studying for Cisco 
based courses.</p>

<h3><strong>GNS3 Configuration Emulated Ethernet 
Switch.</strong> 
<a href="http://itworkbooks.com/category/it-networking/simulator-network-gns3ioupacket-tracer/simulator-gns3/">(Source Origin)</a></h3>

<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>Now that the basics have been covered for the <a title="Basic GNS3 Configuration" href="#InstallingGNS3">set up of GNS3</a>
 in the previous articles it is time to take a look at how to use its 
capabilities to emulate a real environment. This article will take a 
look at the configuration of GNS3 using a emulated Ethernet switch.</p>

<h3>GNS3 Ethernet Switch Capabilities</h3>

<p>The Ethernet switch that will be used by
 GNS3 is part of the Dynagen package that is used by GNS3 to emulate 
routers. While not the equivalent to a Cisco Catalyst switch it can be 
configured in a number of different ways that allow support for most 
common scenarios. Some of these capabilities include the ability to 
perform Ethernet Switching (if that wasn't obvious), as well as support 
for access VLANS, 802.1Q tagged VLANs and QinQ (Stacked) VLANs. Other 
than direct management, these are the features that make up a basic 
managed switch.</p>

<h2>GNS Lab Configuration</h2>
<p>The configuration of a lab that utilizes
 the emulated Ethernet switch functionality is rather simple once the 
configuration of the individual devices has been completed. The 
following figures will walk through the setup of a basic GNS3 lab using 
three routers and a single Ethernet switch with default settings that 
include all devices on the same VLAN (1).</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the beginning configuration of the lab by dragging each of the devices from the Nodes Types pane to the Map pane.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34830" title="Beginning Map Configuration" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-1.jpg" alt="Beginning Map Configuration" height="383" width="577"></p>

<p><em>Figure 1 - Beginning Map Configuration</em></p>

<p>For this example, three different 
routers will be used, each of which have been dragged to the Map pane 
and configured with 2 Fast Ethernet interfaces.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34831" title="Completed Router Map Configuration" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-2.jpg" alt="Completed Router Map Configuration" height="385" width="580"></p>

<p><em>Figure 2 - Completed Router Map Configuration</em></p>

<p>The next figure shows the configuration 
of a Ethernet switch that has been dragged over to the Map pane. For 
this example the default configuration will be used but it is important 
to know where the different options could be configured if needed.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34832" title="Configuring GNS3" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-3.jpg" alt="Configuring GNS3" height="384" width="578"></p>

<p><em>Figure 3 - Configuring a GNS3/Dynagen Ethernet Switch</em></p>

<p>To configure these options Right-Click 
the switch and select the Configure menu option. Once this has been done
 the screen shown in Figure 4 will be displayed. From here you will 
select the Ethernet switch name from the left pane.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34833" title="Ethernet Switch" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-4_002.jpg" alt="Ethernet Switch" height="422" width="580"></p>

<p><em>Figure 4 - Ethernet Switch Node Configuration Screen</em></p>

<p>From the next screen shown in Figure 5 
the user can configure the Ethernet switch based on the requirements of 
the specific lab. By default, there are 8 different switchports that 
will be available that are all configured as access VLAN ports on VLAN 
1. From this screen any specific switchport configuration could be 
completed, setting up additional links between Map pane devices.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34834" title="Switchport Configuration" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-5_002.jpg" alt="Switchport Configuration" height="423" width="581"></p>

<p><em>Figure 5 - Ethernet Switch Switchport Configuration</em></p>

<p>Now that both the routers and the switch
 have been configured it is time to configure the links between the 
devices and the Ethernet switch. To do this select the Add a Link button
 shown in Figure 6.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34835" title="Add a Link" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-6_002.jpg" alt="Add a Link" height="386" width="581"></p>

<p><em>Figure 6 - Add a Link</em></p>

<p>The next few figures show the 
configuration of the links between the routers and the Ethernet switch 
(Note: These figures utilize GNS3's manual link mode available under 
Preferences).</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34836" title="connecting r1" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-7_002.jpg" alt="Connecting R1" height="386" width="581"></p>

<p><em>Figure 7 - Connecting R1</em></p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34837" title="to sw2" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-8.jpg" alt="To SW2" height="386" width="581"></p>

<p><em>Figure 8 - To SW2</em></p>

<p><em>Figure 9 - Connecting R2</em></p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34839" title="SW2" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-10.jpg" alt="SW2" height="388" width="584"></p>

<p><em>Figure 10 - To SW2</em></p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34840" title="Connecting R3" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-11.jpg" alt="Connecting R3" height="387" width="583"></p>

<p><em>Figure 11 - Connecting R3</em></p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34841" title="To SW2 Again" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-12.jpg" alt="To SW2 Again" height="386" width="581"></p>

<p><em>Figure 12 - To SW2</em></p>

<p>Once all of the links have been configured, exit the Add a Link mode as shown in Figure 13.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34842" title="Exit Add a Link Mode" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-13_003.jpg" alt="Exit Add a Link Mode" height="385" width="580"></p>

<p><em>Figure 13 - Exit Add a Link Mode</em></p>

<p>At this point the lab is ready to be 
started, which is shown in Figure 14. Once all of the devices are up and
 running each of the routers can be configured the same as they would if
 there were three physical routers connected to a physical Ethernet 
switch.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34843" title="Completed and Running Emulation" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Figure-14_002.jpg" alt="Completed and Running Emulation" height="384" width="578"></p>

<p><em>Figure 14 - Completed and Running Emulation</em></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>All things being equal, the 
configuration of GNS3 is rather simple once the basics are covered and 
the student has a couple different lab configurations under their belt. 
The Ethernet switch functionality of GNS3/Dynagen is very simple and 
straight forward but it is limited and this should be considered when 
planning the lab topology. Hopefully the content of this article will 
enable the reader/student the ability to get GNS3 up and running and 
configured in the scenario being tested quickly and without much delay. 
This way time can be be spent on learning the networking system and not 
GNS3.</p>

<p>Once the initial <a style="color:#000000;" href="http://itworkbooks.com/2015/01/09/gns3-initial-configuration/">configuration of the Cisco IOS images </a>and
 GNS3 preferences is complete, it is time to begin the process of 
learning how to configure a device. As in real life, each device can be 
configured with a specific amount of memory, disk, and modules. Each of 
these will be covered in this article.</p>

<h2>GNS3 Device Configuration</h2>
<p>The process of configuring a device is 
not overly complex; however it is important that the basic network 
topology be worked out before starting configuration. This article is 
only going to be configuring a single device so the topology is rather 
simple; in this case a single 7206 device will be configured.</p>

<p>The first step in the configuration of a
 device is to add it to the GNS3 map.&nbsp;Figure 1 shows the 7200 
device that will be used in this example.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32403" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-01.jpg" alt="Main GNS3 Map" height="383" width="577"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 1 - Main GNS3 Map</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the process of dragging the 7200 from the node types pane to the main map pane.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32404" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-02.jpg" alt="Dragging a Device to the Map Pane" height="385" width="580"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 2 - Dragging a Device to the Map Pane</p>

<p>Once the device has been dragged over to the main GNS3 pane it will be displayed as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32405" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-03.jpg" alt="Complete Map" height="378" width="580"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 3 - Complete Map</p>

<p>To configure the device it must be 
right-clicked and the Configure option must be selected from the menu. 
Figure 4 shows the menu that will be displayed when a device is 
right-clicked.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32406" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-04.jpg" alt="Right-Clicked Menu" height="377" width="579"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 4 - Right-Clicked Menu</p>

<p>Once Configure is selected the Node configuration window shown in Figure 5 will be displayed.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32407" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-05.jpg" alt="Node Configuration Window" height="421" width="578"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 5 - Node Configuration Window</p>

<p>To configure the device select it from 
the left pane. Figure 6 shows how the right pane changes when the device
 is selected. The general options available for the selected device are 
shown including any hardware options, depending on the platform. 
&nbsp;In this case the 7200 platform midplane (how the modules connect 
to the NPE) and NPE (processor card) are configured from this screen.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32408" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-06.jpg" alt="Device Configuration Node Window" height="434" width="576"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 6 - Device Configuration Node Window</p>

<p>The memories and disks tab offers the 
ability configure the memory and disk allocation for the device. The 
size of the RAM required depends on the specific image being used; 
generally 256 Mbytes is sufficient for most images (to be sure, it can 
be checked at Cisco's Feature Navigator Site (linkto: <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/ITDIT/CFN/jsp/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://tools.cisco.com/ITDIT/CFN/jsp/index.jsp</a>).
 The typical default NVRAM size is 128 Kbytes and the size of the disk 
depends on the specific requirements of the lab; generally a disk is not
 required for a simple lab.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32415" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-071.jpg" alt="Device Memory and Disk Configuration" height="435" width="578"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 7 - Device Memory and Disk Configuration</p>

<p>Figure 8 shows the "Slots" tab; the 
number of configurable slots that are available on each specific 
platform will be shown. In this case the 7206 supports a total of 6 full
 module slots and another slot that is part of the processor card (slot 
0).</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32414" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-08.jpg" alt="Device Slots Tab" height="438" width="582"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 8 - Device Slots Tab</p>

<p>Figure 9 shows the different options 
that are available in Slot 0 of the 7200 platform; as stated before, the
 options are limited because it is part of the processor card.</p>

<p>Figure 10 shows the different options 
that are available on Slot 1 (which will be the same with Slot 2 through
 Slot 6). From the options available, as shown in Figures 9 and 10, 
select the modules that meet the network topology requirements of the 
intended lab. For the purposes of this article it is not important.</p>

<p>The next tab allows the configuration of
 the configuration register; for normal operation this is typically set 
to 0x2102. The base MAC address can also be configured as well; this is 
handy if you are testing a feature that uses this value.</p>

<p>Once the configuration has been 
completed, it is possible to see most of these options selected by 
putting the mouse curser over the configured device as shown in Figure 
12.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It is vital that to properly configure 
GNS3 to emulate a topology that the topology is laid out first, whether 
this is physically on paper or has been thought out mentally. While GNS3
 will automatically select the appropriate adapters if links are created
 on the map, it is often better with more complex topologies to manually
 select the adapters to use on each device. Hopefully the content of 
this article will help in performing these steps for future emulation 
environments.</p>

<p><img class="attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gns3-lab-basic-configuration_featured-image.jpg" alt="Configure a GNS3 Lab" height="125" width="485"></p>

<p>Now that the process of configuring the device has been covered in the previous article, <a href="http://itworkbooks.com/2015/01/09/installing-gns3-network-simulator/">GNS3 Initial Configuration</a>,
 this article will take a look at how to setup GNS3 with two devices and
 then connect them together with a serial cable (virtually of course). 
This article will also go over the process of establishing the IDLE PC 
value.</p>

<h2>GNS3 Basic Lab Configuration</h2>
<p>For those just learning GNS3 it can be take a little time to figure 
out exactly how it works. Since many people just learning GNS3 are also 
just learning networking, it can be even harder. GNS3 was designed to 
take some of the complexity out of emulating Cisco IOS environments 
(among others). The other tools that are available (dynamips/dynagen) 
are still used by GNS3, but are just configured and operated in the 
background. The configuration of labs within GNS3 requires some basic 
level GUI OS proficiency which most people already have.</p>

<p>To begin with, it is best to first have an idea of what the topology 
is going to look like. For this article the topology is going to connect
 two 7206 routers together with a single serial link. The first step to 
set this up is to drag the two 7200s from the nodes types pane to the 
map pane. This process is shown in Figures 1-4 below:</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32421" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-011.jpg" alt="Select the 7200 Series Router" height="394" width="605"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 1 - Select the 7200 Series Router</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32422" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-021.jpg" alt="Drag the First Router to the Map pane" height="396" width="608"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 2 - Drag the First Router to the Map pane</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32423" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-031.jpg" alt="Select the 7200 Series Router Again" height="395" width="606"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 3 - Select the 7200 Series Router Again</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32424" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-041.jpg" alt="Drag the Second Router to the Map pane" height="395" width="606"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 4 - Drag the Second Router to the Map pane</p>

<p>Now that the two routers have been placed on the map pane, the two 
need to be connected together with a serial link. The Add a Link tool is
 in the top navigation bar and resembles a cable connector, once it is 
clicked the different types of link available are shown for selection. 
In this case a serial link is going to be used to connect the two 
devices. The selection of a Serial link is shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32425" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-051.jpg" alt="Add a Link Tool - Selecting Serial Link Type" height="395" width="606"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 5 - Add a Link Tool - Selecting Serial Link Type</p>

<p>Once the link type has been selected, connecting together devices is 
as simple as clicking the first device and then clicking the second 
device; this process is shown in Figure 6-8. Once the link has been 
successfully created, the map pane will reflect the link between them 
with red dots, these dots indicate that the interface is not enabled (in
 this case the router has not been started yet.).</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32426" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-061.jpg" alt="Select the First Device" height="394" width="605"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 6 - Select the First Device</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32427" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-072.jpg" alt="Select the Second Device" height="395" width="606"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 7 - Select the Second Device</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32428" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-081.jpg" alt="A Completed Serial Link" height="396" width="608"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 8 - A Completed Serial Link</p>

<p>Once all of the Serial links have been completed, the Add a Link tool
 needs to be disabled; this is done by clicking on the Add a Link tool 
again. When it is active, the thumbnail will change to a red X. Figure 9
 shows the thumbnail that will need to be selected.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32429" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-091.jpg" alt="Disabling the Add a Link Tool" height="397" width="609"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 9 - Disabling the Add a Link Tool</p>

<p>Once you have disabled the Add a Link tool, the lab and the two 
devices is complete. These following parts cover the steps required to 
configure the IDLE PC value; the IDLE PC value is important as it 
enables GNS3/dynamips to more efficiently use the host processor. 
Without it, the process utilization of the host machine will often be at
 100%. To begin, a single device needs to be started and allowed to 
completely boot up. Figures 10-12 show the process of starting R1 and 
displaying the console. Watch the console until the device has been 
completely booted up and no additional messages are being displayed.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32430" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-101.jpg" alt="Starting R1" height="395" width="606"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 10 - Starting R1</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32431" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-111.jpg" alt="Displaying R1's Console" height="394" width="605"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 11 - Displaying R1's Console</p>

<p align="center">Figure 12 - Watch the Console</p>

<p>Once the device has booted up and is idle, the IDLE PC value can be 
calculated. Figures 13 and 14 show the process of calculating the IDLE 
PC value and selecting the best value. The best values that GNS3 
believes will provide the least processor utilization are shown with a <strong>'*'</strong>, so select the one that provides the least processor utilization.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32433" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-13.jpg" alt="Calculating the IDLE PC Value" height="388" width="595"></p>

<p align="center">Figure 14 - Select a Value with a '*'</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The process of calculating the IDLE PC only needs to be done once for
 each router model type, once it is calculated it will automatically be 
added to the configuration of all other similar models. Hopefully the 
content of this article enables the reader to set up a simple lab and 
become familiar with the process of using GNS3 and will help in future 
studies.</p>

				<h4 class="medium h4"><strong>Using the GNS3 Network Simulator.</strong></h4>

<p>Today we will be taking a closer look at
 another network simulator that can be used by candidates while 
preparing for their Cisco exams.</p>

<p>The Packet Tracer, by Cisco, is a really
 cool tool for CCNA candidates, but it really can't be used by 
candidates who are preparing for their professional and Expert level 
certs. The scenarios and labs that are done at these levels are way too 
complex.</p>

<p>As a professional level candidate you have just 3 options that are available to you.</p>

<p>You can invest the money to build your 
own lab using real Cisco gear. However, this is the most expensive 
option that not everyone can afford. Just the cost of the Cisco routers 
and switches will be enough to make anyone scream, not to mention the 
added charges to your electricity bill.</p>

<p>Your second option would be to rent rack
 time at one of the many vendors that provide this service. This is not a
 bad option. It is way cheaper than building your own lab and you get to
 practice on real equipment. The only down side to this is having to 
schedule your lab for an available time.</p>

<p>This might not seem like a big deal to 
most, but for me, it really is as my mind works differently; I usually 
have these phases that I like to call my "In the Zone" phases when I'm 
so focused on my studies that I can't be bothered with whatever else is 
going on around me. Having to schedule my lab time to a date that is 
available and not exactly when I would like to do the lab (NOW!!!) can 
be somewhat inconveniencing. The only available date might be at a time 
when you just had a bad day, or you're really just not in the mood for 
studying.</p>

<p>This is where your third option come in really handy. It's called the <a href="http://www.gns3.net/download/" target="_blank">GNS3</a> network simulator.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10150" title="GNS3 Network Simulator" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/gns3-network-simulator1.png" alt="GNS3 Network Simulator" height="100" width="300" align="right"></p>

<h4>What is GNS3 Really About?</h4>

<p>The GNS3 network simulator is free, open source software that can be downloaded and used by anyone. You can access the download <a href="http://www.gns3.net/download/" target="_blank">at this link</a>.</p>

<p>GNS3 works by using real Cisco IOS images which are emulated using a program called <a href="http://itworkbooks.com/2015/01/09/how-to-configure-dynagen-and-gns3/">Dynamips.</a></p>

<p>GNS3 is really like the GUI part of the 
overall product. With this GUI, users get an easy to use interface that 
allows them to build complex labs consisting of a variety of supported 
Cisco routers.</p>

<p>The program that does the real job of 
emulating the routers using real IOS images is Dynamips. Most people 
refer to this as the back-end to the whole operation whereas Dynagen is 
referred to as the front-end. This is mainly because Dynagen 
communicates with <a href="http://itworkbooks.com/2015/01/09/how-to-configure-dynagen-and-gns3/">Dynamips</a> using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor" target="_blank">Hypervisor</a> -- all this put together helps to make the configuration process simpler.</p>

<p>Now, take this added usability and throw
 in the GUI provided by GNS3, and you've gotten yourself a really 
powerful, easy to use simulator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Some Supported GNS3 Features</h4>

<p>GNS3 website lists the following as some of the features provided by the simulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design of high quality and complex network topologies</li>
<li>Emulation of many Cisco router platforms and PIX firewalls</li>
<li>Simulation of simple Ethernet, ATM and Frame Relay switches</li>
<li>Connection of the simulated network to the real world</li>
<li>Packet capture using Wireshark</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10142" title="GNS3" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/12.jpg" alt="GNS3" height="343" width="334" align="right"></p>

<h4>GNS3 Supported Platforms</h4>

<p>These are the current platforms supported by GNS3.</p>

<p>As you can see from the table, you've got quite a list of devices that can be used with GNS3 to build your labs.</p>

<p>This is definitely another great feature of this simulator.</p>

<p>As you all know, with each different model of Cisco devices, you have more or less features supported by that model.</p>

<p>These mostly range from the types of commands supported on the particular IOS you're running for that platform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Using the GNS3 Network Simulator</h4>

<p>Next, we're going to take a look at some screen shots so that you get an idea of what an actual lab looks like.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-10151" title="GNS3 Network Simulator" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Network-Simulator2.jpg" alt="GNS3 Network Simulator" height="444" width="596"></p>

<p>This is the basic look of GNS3 when you 
start the program. To the left of the image is where all the devices are
 listed. From this area you would drag the devices you are going to use 
for the particular lab to the work area -center of the screen.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-10158" title="GNS3 Network Simulator" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Network-Simulator3.jpg" alt="GNS3 Network Simulator" height="447" width="598"></p>

<p>Here we have a shot of a Frame Relay lab consisting of 3 routers.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-10159" title="GNS3 Network Simulator" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Network-Simulator4.jpg" alt="GNS3 Network Simulator" height="448" width="617"></p>

<p>Finally, you can see the results of issuing the show run command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Some Final Considerations</h4>

<p>There is definitely a lot that can be 
done with the GNS3 network simulator. As you've seen from the screen 
shots above, you're able to really configure your own labs using the 
devices you need, thereby giving you exactly the required practice 
needed for a particular Cisco exam.</p>

<p>However, there are some drawbacks to 
using GNS3. The main one being that you need your own Cisco IOS images 
in order to make use of the simulator. GNS3 does not come with built-in 
IOS images and explicitly states on the front of their page that users 
must provide their own IOS images.</p>

<p>In order for you to obtain IOS images 
you will need a CCO account, after which you're able to download the 
images directly from Cisco's website. We do not encourage getting these 
images by any other means.</p>

<p>Another drawback would be the amount of 
CPU resources used by GNS3. Well, to be technically correct, it isn't 
GNS3 that is actually using up the resources of your CPU. It's actually 
Dynamips and this can be seen from your Task Manager in Windows.</p>

<p>I've used GNS3 on a number of occasions 
while preparing for different Cisco exams and when I wanted to test a 
configuration in the lab before putting it into production. It's really a
 good tool to have as an aspiring Cisco Engineer and as a network admin 
in general.</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about 
GNS3 and how to configure different labs using it, check out this 
article that covers both <a href="http://itworkbooks.com/2015/01/09/how-to-configure-dynagen-and-gns3/">GNS3 and Dynagen configurations</a> or visit the <a href="http://www.gns3.net/" target="_blank">GNS3 website</a> where you'll find access to a number of documentations.</p>

				<h4 class="medium h4"><strong>How to Configure Dynagen and GNS3.</strong></h4>

<p>When studying for the many of the Cisco certifications it is best to get some amount of hands-on experience.</p>

<p>For many students this may be possible 
by simply doing their normal day-to-day jobs but for many more this 
opportunity is not possible. In order to fill this void there are really
 three main solutions: buy or rent Cisco equipment to interact with 
directly, purchase a Cisco simulator or run one of the dynamips 
emulation solutions.</p>

<p>While buying the equipment will get you 
hands-on experience, it does require a decent amount of upfront 
investment and may not be required if your interests are simply to 
understand basic Cisco configuration and technology.</p>

<p>There are many good simulation solutions
 out there (including one I worked on from Cisco Press), but the problem
 with some of these solutions is flexibility. Many of these simulations 
do quite well to simulate the environment but they are only programmed 
to understand the commands required in their simulations and thus don't 
scale well outside of this specific set of labs.</p>

<h2>Dynamips Emulation Solutions</h2>
<p>Dynamips is a solution which emulates 
specific Cisco hardware; this is then used in concert with a real Cisco 
IOS image. These emulations do seem to be the best of the available 
solutions but there is a catch -- technically the use of an IOS image not
 on a licensed Cisco device is a breach of the license (as far as I have
 been told). Although to my knowledge, Cisco has not gone after anyone, 
it should be noted. The IOS image must also be obtained through a source
 other than those distributing the dynamips solutions as they can't 
provide this image.</p>

<h2>Learn the Basics of Dynagen and GNS3</h2>
<p>At this time the two available dynamips solutions are Dynagen and GNS3.</p>

<p>Dynagen utilizes a text based 
configuration file which is used to specify the specific parameters to 
be used. These parameters include the IOS image location, number and 
name of the routers used, the specific interfaces emulated on each 
router, and the specific connection configuration between the routers.</p>

<p>Dynagen also provides access to a 
simulated Ethernet or Frame Relay switch which can be used to connect 
the various routers. These switches are simple emulations of the 
switches and thus do not provide the functionality of a normal Cisco 
switch.</p>

<p>GNS3 takes this a step further by 
allowing the user to build a lab via a Windows interface that looks 
similar to Microsoft Visio or similar tools. GNS3 will build the text 
configuration files for you and can be used later to utilize the same 
lab structure.</p>

<h2>Basic Dynagen Configuration</h2>
<p>Just to get people familiar with the 
Dynagen interface we will go over the configuration of a simple Dynagen 
lab configuration. The first thing that must be done is to locate a copy
 of Cisco IOS and to obtain a copy of Dynagen and install it.</p>

<p>Now the following includes a simple two 
router configuration which utilizes Frame Relay and Ethernet connections
 to tie them together.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9987" title="Simple two router configuration " src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/11.jpg" alt="Simple two router configuration " height="569" width="627"></p>

<p>Now let's review the configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>[localhost] specifies that dynamips 
will be running on the local machine and utilize the default port of 
7200. This can be changed to another IP address or port if dynamips is 
not running locally.</li>
<li>[[7200]] specifies the configuration to
 be used for the emulated 7200 router. As of this writing dynamips 
supports 2600 series (2610 to 2650XM, 2691), 3600 series (3620, 3640 and
 3660), 3700 series (3725, 3745) and 7200 routers.</li>
<li>image = \Program Files\Dynamips\images\c7200-adventerprisek9-mz.124-15.T.unzip.bin specifies the location of the Cisco IOS image.</li>
<li>npe = npe-400 specifies the type of 
Network Processing Engine used by the emulated 7200 (This is essentially
 the brain of the 7200 router).</li>
<li>ram = 256 specifies the amount of RAM reserved for each instance of a 7200 router.</li>
<li>slot0 = PA-C7200-IO-FE specifies the type of interface card which is emulated in slot0 of the 7200 router.</li>
<li>slot1 = PA-4T specifies the type of interface card which is emulated in slot1 of the 7200 router.</li>
<li>[[ROUTER R1]] specifies the configuration of a router named R1.</li>
<li>F0/0 = S1 1 specifies that the F0/0 interface of the router will be connected to port 1 on switch S1.</li>
<li>S1/0 = F1 1 specifies that the S1/0 interface of the router will be connected to port 1 on Frame Relay switch F1.</li>
<li>model = 7200 specifies that this router
 will emulate a 7200 router and will thus use the configuration 
specified in that section as well.</li>
<li>[[ROUTER R2]] specifies the configuration of a router named R2.</li>
<li>F0/0 = S1 2 specifies that the F0/0 interface of the router will be connected to port 2 on switch S1.</li>
<li>S1/0 = F1 2 specifies that the S1/0 interface of the router will be connected to port 2 on Frame Relay switch F1.</li>
<li>model = 7200 specifies that this router
 will emulate a 7200 router and will again use the configuration 
specified in that section.</li>
<li>[[ETHSW S1]] specifies the configuration of an Ethernet switch named S1</li>
<li>1 = access 1 specifies that port 1 on the switch will be an access port and be in VLAN 1.</li>
<li>2 = access 1 specifies that port 2 on the switch will be an access port and be in VLAN 1.</li>
<li>[[FRSWF1]] specifies that configuration of a Frame Relay switch named F1</li>
<li>1:101 = 2:201 specifies that port 1 on 
the switch will connect using a DLCI of 101 and that it connects to port
 2 on the switch with a DLCI of 201.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course much more complicated 
configurations can be created in order to emulate a number of different 
situations. All of the specific documentation can be found at the 
Dynagen website.</p>

<p>In order to gain access to the router instances you should use a telnet application like <a style="color:#000000;" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/">putty</a>.
 Using the above configuration, R1 would be accessed using the IP 
Address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and a port number of 2000. R2 would be 
accessed using the same IP address and a port number of 2001 and so on.</p>

<h2>Basic GNS3 Configuration</h2>
<p>Now GNS3 takes advantage of the 
interface of Dynagen and takes it a step further to make the creation of
 the lab file easier. It also adds the ability to emulate other systems 
including Cisco's PIX platform and Juniper's JUNOS but this will not be 
covered in this article.</p>

<p>Again with GNS you require a copy of Cisco IOS and a copy of <a href="http://www.gns3.net/">GNS3</a> and install it. Once this is complete run GNS3, this will bring up a screen like this:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9988" title="GNS3" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Shot-1.jpg" alt="GNS3" width="600"></p>

<p>You must then configure GNS3 with the 
location of the IOS images so that it can reference them once the 
topology is created. This option is located off the edit menu:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9989" title="GNS3 - 2" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Shot-2.jpg" alt="GNS3 - 2" width="600"></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9990" title="GNS3 - 3" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Shot-3.jpg" alt="GNS3 - 3" width="600"></p>

<p>Once in this configuration screen browse
 to the IOS image; once selected, GNS3 will populate the Platform with 
the available hardware options. From this screen you can also manually 
set the IDLE PC parameter (not required but helpful to limit physical 
memory use) and the Default device RAM parameter.</p>

<p>Once this is completed you should take 
the time to create the topology that is required using the devices on 
the left pane. The following shows the same topology that was created in
 the Dynagen section:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9991" title="GNS3 - 4" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Shot-4.jpg" alt="GNS3 - 4" width="600"></p>

<p>Once this is complete the dynamips can 
be started by using the play button on the top tool bar, this starts all
 devices and all interfaces will show as up (green):</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9992" title="GNS3 - 5" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Shot-5.jpg" alt="GNS3 - 5" width="600"></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9993" title="GNS3 - 6" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GNS3-Shot-6.jpg" alt="GNS3 - 6" width="600"></p>

<p>Accessing the routers through GNS3 is done by right clicking on the target device and selecting console.</p>

<p>While every engineer is going to have 
their preferences, both of these tools work well to emulate Cisco's IOS 
and are extremely helpful in preparation for many of Cisco's 
certification tests.</p>

<p><img class="attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gns3-initial-configuration_featured-image.jpg" alt="GNS3 Initial Configuration Tutorial" height="119" width="462"></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>With the introduction of dynamips as a 
Cisco IOS emulation tool, it is now possible to emulate almost any Cisco
 IOS image in a simulated hardware environment. Of course the main 
problem with dynamips was that it was a CLI tool that required a lot of 
parameter knowledge. To make the configuration easier, the dynagen tool 
was developed to provide an INI file-like configuration interface. For 
most of the old school engineers out there this was familiar, and easy 
to figure out and configure. GNS3 was developed to take the ease of the 
configuration to a whole new level; this included a GUI-style interface 
that most people familiar with Windows based systems understood (almost 
anyone with a computer). GNS3 added additional abilities to the dynamips
 platform including support for Cisco PIX and ASA as well as Junipers - 
JunOS. This article is a second in a series of <a href="http://itworkbooks.com/2015/01/09/installing-gns3-network-simulator/">GNS3 configuration</a>
 articles that aims to make the simulation of Cisco IOS environments 
easier to understand and get those engineers out there looking to become
 Cisco IOS proficient a stepping stone.</p>

<h2>Dynamips/GNS3 Issues</h2>
<p>Before this article goes any further, we
 should point out that the only way to have either of these products 
emulate a real IOS environment is to already have access to an existing 
IOS image. Dynamips, dynagen and GNS3 don't include these images (this 
is because the legality is in question). Before anyone can use these 
products, they must obtain one of these images for the platform being 
emulated. There are ways to get these legally (purchase a Cisco SMARTnet
 contract or have an existing Cisco IOS device) and not so legally (look
 online); this article will not condone or approve the method used in 
obtaining this image. For the purposes of this article, an image for a 
Cisco 7206 platform (7200) will be used.</p>

<h2>GNS3 Initial Configuration</h2>
<p>The main parts of the initial 
configuration of GNS3 to ready it for Cisco IOS emulation is the 
configuration of Cisco IOS images into GNS3 and the configuration of any
 non-default preferences. The following group of figures will show the 
different steps required to set up Cisco IOS images and walk through the
 different preference options that can be configured when emulating 
Cisco IOS.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the main GNS3 screen.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32439" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-012.jpg" alt="Figure 1 - Main GNS3 Screen" height="410" width="617"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 1 - Main GNS3 Screen</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the menu item to be selected to configure the Cisco IOS images.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32440" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-022.jpg" alt="Figure 2 - IOS Image Menu Path" height="407" width="613"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 2 - IOS Image Menu Path</p>

<p>Once the IOS images and hypervisors menu
 option is selected, the screen shown in Figure 3 will be displayed. On 
this screen the path to the IOS image can be selected by clicking the 
browse button as shown.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32441" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-032.jpg" alt="Figure 3 - IOS Image Selection" height="456" width="612"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 3 - IOS Image Selection</p>

<p>Once the browse button is selected the 
file selection window shown in Figure 4 will appear; browse to the 
location of the image and select it and press the open button.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32442" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-042.jpg" alt="Figure 4 - File Selection Window" height="458" width="611"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 4 - File Selection Window</p>

<p>Typically, the Platform will auto 
populate if the IOS filename remains within Cisco's naming convention 
and the model options available will populate the Model dropdown box. As
 shown in Figure 5, the platform of the selected IOS image is c7200 and 
the only model supported is a 7200. If for some reason the 
auto-population did not work, select the appropriate platform and model.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32443" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-052.jpg" alt="Figure 5 - Platform and Model Population" height="454" width="609"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 5 - Platform and Model Population</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the IDLE PC 
value is important but will be populated when the first lab is run with 
this IOS image and the IDLE PC process is completed; just leave it blank
 for now. Once the options are correct select the save button, once this
 is done a screen like that shown in Figure 6 will appear. Once the 
configuration is saved select the Close button.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32444" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-062.jpg" alt="Figure 6 - Cisco IOS Image Configuration - Save" height="454" width="609"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 6 - Cisco IOS Image Configuration - Save</p>

<p>The second part of this article will 
display the screens used to configure the different preferences 
available for GNS3, generally speaking the default settings should work 
for most people. Figure 7 shows the menu item to be selected to 
configure GNS3 preferences.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32445" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-073.jpg" alt="Figure 7 - GNS3 Preferences" height="403" width="607"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 7 - GNS3 Preferences</p>

<p>Figure 8 shows the main general 
preferences screen; there are a couple of different options here that 
someone may want to alter including the project and OS image 
directories.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32446" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-082.jpg" alt="Figure 8 - General Preference Screen" height="548" width="606"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 8 - General Preference Screen</p>

<p>The terminal settings screen shown in 
Figure 9 can be used to select the preferred terminal application. Putty
 is generally included with the GNS3 installation, but SecureCRT, Telnet
 and Teraterm are supported as well.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32447" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-092.jpg" alt="Figure 9 - Terminal Settings" height="548" width="606"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 9 - Terminal Settings</p>

<p>The Dynamips configuration options can 
be altered if required, however, the default options will work for 
almost all individuals.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32448" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-102.jpg" alt="Figure 10 - Dynamips Options" height="550" width="608"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 10 - Dynamips Options</p>

<p>The one option that may need to be 
altered is the amount of memory that is allowed to be used per 
hypervisor (each session of dynamips); value will be needed because this
 will depend on the Cisco IOS image memory configuration. For beginning 
configurations, the default configuration will work fine. If this memory
 usage limit does need to be configured the screen shown in Figure 11 
should be used.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-32449" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Figure-112.jpg" alt="Figure 11 - Dynamips Hypervisor Configuration" height="550" width="608"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 11 - Dynamips Hypervisor Configuration</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Once the Cisco IOS images have each been
 configured (configure each image that will be used in the emulation), 
GNS3 is then ready to be used. The next article in this series will 
cover how to setup a single Cisco IOS device within GNS3. 
&nbsp;Hopefully the contents of this article will enable the reader to 
get to a point where this is easily completed.</p>

				<h4 class="medium h4"><strong>Installing GNS3 Network Simulator.</strong></h4>

<p><img class="attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gns3-network-simulator-install_featured-image.jpg" alt="GNS3 Network Simulator Installation" height="123" width="477"></p>

<p>There are two main ways that GNS3 can be
 installed, either by using the all-in-one installer or by using one of 
the standalone packages. The standalone packages are not installers but 
simply an archive that can be extracted and run directly; this is a very
 useful option for those who do not want to run through the installation
 process. The option that will be covered in this article is the 
installer which includes the installation of Dynamips, Qemu/Pemu, Putty,
 VPCS, WinPcap and Wireshark.</p>

<h2>GNS3 Installation</h2>
<p>The installation of GNS3 is simple and 
the different options to select are based on the specific configuration 
of the target machine. The installation shown in this article will 
install all required programs and assumes nothing has been previously 
installed.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to obtain the GNS3 installer available at <a href="http://www.gns3.net/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gns3.net/download/</a>. Once this file is downloaded, click on the executable file as shown in Figure 1:</p>

<p>Once the installer has been launched, the screen shown in Figure 2 will be displayed; once at this screen press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="  wp-image-31708 aligncenter" title="Click on the GNS3 Installation Executable" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-1.jpg" alt="Click on the GNS3 Installation Executable" height="347" width="461"></p>

<p>The next screen will display the license information to install GNS3 
and its associated programs. &nbsp;If the terms are agreeable press the I
 Agree button.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31710" title="GNS3 License Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-3.jpg" alt="GNS3 License Screen" height="351" width="451"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
select a Start Menu folder name to insert the associated GNS3 shortcuts 
into; most people just leave this at the default of GNS3. &nbsp;Once a 
name has been selected you will press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31711" title="Start Menu Name Selection" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-4.jpg" alt="Start Menu Name Selection" height="362" width="465"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
customize the installation by selecting which components will be 
installed; select the components that are required for the specific 
installation and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31712" title="GNS3 Component Selection" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-5.jpg" alt="GNS3 Component Selection" height="366" width="471"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
select where the GNS3 programs and most of its components will be 
installed. Select the appropriate path and press the Install button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31713" title="GNS3 Install Location" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-6.jpg" alt="GNS3 Install Location" height="363" width="467"></p>

<p>If WinPcap was selected to be installed,
 the next few screens will be shown as the WinPcap installer is 
completed. &nbsp;Once this screen is shown, press the Next button. If 
WinPcap was not selected move to Figure 11.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31714" title="WinPcap Installer Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-7.jpg" alt="WinPcap Installer Screen" height="362" width="465"></p>

<p>Read the next screen and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31715" title="WinPcap Installer Setup Wizard Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-8.jpg" alt="WinPcap Installer Setup Wizard Screen" height="361" width="464"></p>

<p>The next screen will display the license
 information to install WinPcap. &nbsp;If the terms are agreeable press 
the I Agree button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31716" title="WinPcap License Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-9.jpg" alt="WinPcap License Screen" height="359" width="462"></p>

<p>On the next screen select whether the WinPcap driver will be automatically started at boot. This is typical.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31717" title="WinPcap Driver on Startup" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-10.jpg" alt="WinPcap Driver on Startup" height="357" width="459"></p>

<p>Once the installer has finished it will display the final screen shown in Figure 11, press the Finish button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31718" title="WinPcap Installer Finish" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-11.jpg" alt="WinPcap Installer Finish" height="353" width="454"></p>

<p>If Wireshark was selected to be 
installed, the next few screens will be shown as the Wireshark installer
 is completed; once this screen is shown press the Next button. If 
Wireshark was not selected move to Figure 21.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31719" title="Wireshark Installer Setup Wizard Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-12.jpg" alt="Wireshark Installer Setup Wizard Screen" height="356" width="458"></p>

<p>The next screen will display the license
 information to install Wireshark. &nbsp;If the terms are agreeable 
press the I Agree button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31720" title="Wireshark License Screen" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-13.jpg" alt="Wireshark License Screen" height="359" width="462"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
customize the installation by selecting which components will be 
installed; select the components that are required for the specific 
installation and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31721" title="Wireshark Component Selection" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-14.jpg" alt="Wireshark Component Selection" height="344" width="442"></p>

<p>The next screen will ask which shortcuts
 to install as part of the Wireshark installation and ask if a number of
 different file associations should be associated to Wireshark. Select 
the wanted options and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31722" title="Wireshark Additional Tasks" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-15.jpg" alt="Wireshark Additional Tasks" height="348" width="448"></p>

<p>The next screen will allow the user to 
select where Wireshark will be installed. Select the appropriate path 
and press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31723" title="Wireshark Install Location" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/figure-16.jpg" alt="Wireshark Install Location" height="353" width="454"></p>

<p>The next screen will ask if WinPcap 
should be installed as well. &nbsp;Since WinPcap was probably already 
installed first by the GNS3 installer, this option will probably not be 
selected; once done press the Install button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31724" title="Install WinPCap (Wireshark Installer)" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-17.jpg" alt="Install WinPCap (Wireshark Installer)" height="345" width="444"></p>

<p>At this point the Wireshark installer will start as shown in Figure 17.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31725" title="Wireshark Installing" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-18.jpg" alt="Wireshark Installing" height="349" width="449"></p>

<p>Once the Wireshark installation is complete the screen shown in Figure 18 will be displayed; once done press the Next button.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31726" title="Wireshark Installation Complete" src="http://blog.pluralsight.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Figure-19.jpg" alt="Wireshark Installation Complete" height="349" width="449"></p>

<p>At the next screen <strong>don't</strong> select the Run Wireshark option (this is because the GNS3 installer is still running) and press the Finish button.</p>
