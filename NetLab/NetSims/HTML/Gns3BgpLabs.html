<p class="dropcap">Hi all, In this article we will configure a Cisco Router to act 
as a Frame Relay Switch. We have used Cisco routers 3700 series in GNS3. To 
demonstrate comunication through Frame Relay Switch we connected to it two end 
devices (routers in our case), <span id="more-165"></span>we configured them with 
their IP addresses and prepared to support Frame Relay Encapsulation on interfaces 
connected to FR Switch. (<strong><a title="Cisco Router as Frame Relay Switch" 
href="http://www.getnetworking.net/networking/tutorials/5/watch/">Watch the 
video</a></strong>)</p>

<p>But first a little bit about the logic of this configuration:</p>

<p>To work as Frame Relay switch must enable Frame Relay Switching on Router by using 
<strong><em>frame-relay switching</em></strong>, next go under interface configuration 
mode and set interface as DCE with <strong><em>frame-relay intf-type dce</em></strong> 
command, after that set clock rate with <strong><em>clock rate</em></strong> command, 
and use <strong><em>frame-relay route</em></strong> to route traffic from one DLCI of 
a interface to another DLCI of a interface. In next picture is presented topology for 
this lab.</p>


<img alt="Router As Frame Relay Switch" src="http://www.getnetworking.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Router_As_Frame_Relay_Switch.png" height="280" width="540">

<p class="wp-caption-text">Router As Frame Relay Switch</p>

<p>From the picture is seen that DLCI 100 is assigned to interface attached to R1 and 
DLCI 200 is assigned to attached to R2. In box bellow is shown how to do this:</p>

<p><strong>FR1</strong></p>

<pre>frame-relay switching 

interface Serial0/0
no ip address
encapsulation frame-relay
clock rate 64000
frame-relay intf-type dce
frame-relay route 100 interface Serial0/1 200 

interface Serial0/1
no ip address
encapsulation frame-relay
clock rate 64000
frame-relay intf-type dce
frame-relay route 200 interface Serial0/0 100
</pre>

<p>These are simple steps that you should do on router to act as FR Switch, next will 
configure two end devices that are connected to FR1 and use DLCI 100 and 200 
respectively.</p>

<p><strong>R1</strong></p>

<pre>interface Serial0/0
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
encapsulation frame-relay
</pre>

<p><strong>R2</strong></p>

<pre>interface Serial0/0
ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
encapsulation frame-relay
</pre>

<p>Now let's verify configuration and connectivity between end routers for this lab, in 
screenshots bellow are shown output of command <strong><em>show frame-relay 
route</em></strong> on FR switch, <strong><em>show frame-relay pvc</em></strong> and 
<strong><em>show frame-relay map</em></strong> on end routers and of course ping 
command.</p>

<p>This lab is an advanced <a href="http://freeciscolab.com/2010/12/12/free-cisco-lab-gns3-scenario-ccie-final-assessment/" target="_blank">CCIE</a>
 service provided lab that I discovered on one of the many Cisco forums 
online dedicated to providing help to Cisco students and network 
engineers alike. I tough that it was an excellent practice scenario for 
anyone studying for the service provider exam or if you just like gain a
 better understand of <a href="http://freeciscolab.com/2013/12/05/free-gns3-lab-basic-mpls-configuration/">MPLS</a>. This lab was originally created by P.Kaczor, CCIE #24301. I created a <a href="http://freeciscolab.com/2014/04/01/cisco-ios-requirements-certification-exams/">GNS3</a> topology and the solution configuration so you will have something to compare your solution when you have completed the lab.<span id="more-1913"></span><br>

<P> If you have completed passing you CCIE routing and switching exam and 
lab and you are looking for a new challenge you might want to pursue the
 CCIE service provider certification. The CCIE Service Provider path 
focuses on the skills required for proficiency in the service provider 
networking arena. The CCIE Service Provider certification certifies you 
are an expert in IP fundamentals and technologies as well as building an
 extensible service provider network infrastructure to provide rich 
managed services. Those certified as CCIE Service Provider will possess 
advanced skills related to packet architecture and technologies 
essential to service providers such as service provisioning, MPLS, VPNs,
 service level agreements and basic security.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives:</h3>

<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/03/31/ccnp-ios-requirments-gns3/" 
target="newwindow">GNS3</a> to model a simple lab to demonstrate how to configure and

target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> in a multiple autonomous system implementation. 
Additionally we will learn path control and route summarization.</p>

<h4>EIGRP:</h4>

<p><a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is an 
advanced distance-vector routing protocol that permits 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/02/28/build-ccnp-lab-home/" 
target="newwindow">routers</a> to exchange Path information in a more efficient way 
than with previous network protocols. 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> grew out of IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> or IGRP can interoperate because the metric used with 
one protocol can be translated into the metrics of the other protocol.</p>

<p><a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a>, a router maintains a copy of its neighbor's routing 
tables. If it cannot locate the route to a destination in one of these tables, it 
queries its neighbors for a route and they in turn query their neighbors until a 
route is found. When a routing table entry changes in one of the 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/02/28/build-ccnp-lab-home/" 
target="newwindow">routers</a>, it notifies its neighbors of the only the changes 
unlike previous protocols that require sending the entire routing table. To keep all 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/02/28/build-ccnp-lab-home/" 
target="newwindow">routers</a> aware of the state of neighbors, each router sends 
out a periodic "hello" packet. A router from which no "hello" packet has been received 
in a certain period of time is assumed to be inoperative.</p>

<p><a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> uses the Diffusing-Update Algorithm (DUAL) to determine 
the most efficient route to a destination based on cost. A DUAL finite state machine 
contains decision information used by the algorithm to determine the least-cost 
route.</p>

<h4>Autonomous System:</h4>

<p>Each <a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> process is identified by an autonomous system (AS) number, 
just like IGRP processes. 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/02/28/build-ccnp-lab-home/" 
target="newwindow">Routers</a> with the same AS numbers will exchange routing 
information with each other, resulting in a routing domain. 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/02/28/build-ccnp-lab-home/" 
target="newwindow">Routers</a> with dissimilar AS numbers will not exchange any 
routing information by default. However, routes from one routing domain can be leaked 
into another domain through the 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/04/24/free-ccnp-gns3-lab-advanced-redistribution/" 
target="newwindow">redistribution</a> commands.</p>

<h4>Route Summarization:</h4>

<p>The default behavior of 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> is to summarize on network-number boundaries. This is 
similar to RIP and IGRP and is a prudent way for a routing protocol to reduce the 
number of routes that are propagated between 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/02/28/build-ccnp-lab-home/" 
target="newwindow">routers</a>.</p>

<h4>Load Balancing:</h4>

<p>In general, load balancing is the capability of a router to distribute traffic over 
all the router network ports that are the same distance from the destination address. 
Load balancing increases the utilization of network segments, and so increases 
effective network bandwidth. There are two types of load balancing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Equal cost path - Applicable when different paths to a destination network report 
      the same routing metric value. The maximum-paths command determines the maximum 
      number of routes that the routing protocol can use.</li>
  <li>Unequal cost path - Applicable when different paths to a destination network 
      report are of different routing metric values. The variance command determines 
      which of these routes is used by the router.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every routing protocol supports equal cost path load balancing. In addition, 
<a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> also support unequal cost path load balancing. Use the 
variance n command in order to instruct the router to include routes with a metric of 
less than n times the minimum metric route for that destination. The variable n can 
take a value between 1 and 128. The default is 1, which means equal cost load 
balancing. Traffic is also distributed among the links with unequal costs, 
proportionately, with respect to the metric.</p>

<h4>EGIRP Metric:</h4>

<p><a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2012/01/03/basic-eigrp-configuration-gns3-lab/" 
target="newwindow">EIGRP</a> uses the minimum bandwidth on the path to a destination 
network and the total delay to compute routing metrics. Although you can configure 
other metrics, we do not recommend it, as it can cause routing loops in your network. 
The bandwidth and delay metrics are determined from values configured on the interfaces 
of <a href="http://freeccnplab.com/2014/02/28/build-ccnp-lab-home/" 
target="newwindow">routers</a> in the path to the destination network.</p>
