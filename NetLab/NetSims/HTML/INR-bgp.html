<h4>Abstract</h4>

<P> Today we will be setting up BGP. As with OSPF and RIP we will be using 
Quagga, using your own configuration files. 

<a name="Sec1"></a><h4>1 Preparation</h4> 

<P> For this assignment you will need an IP address in an IX network, an IPv4 network 
range and a private AS-number to set up your own network. Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>
 lists your assigned numbers. 

<UL>
  <LI> Choose a configuration from a previous assignment and renumber the IP addresses 
       to addresses in your designated IPv4 range. This network should have at least 
       two routers and two subnets. This will be the network that you attach to the 
       exchange. 
  <LI> Choose one router in your network, and designate it as a border router. Create 
       a tap interface to the physical network. Disable OSPF/RIP on this interface and 
       configure BGP on this router. 
  <LI> Connect your router to the network of the OS3-IX using the instructions in 
       section <a href="#Sec2">2</a>.
</UL>
 

<P> The OS3 Internet exchange OS3-IX is a LAN-based Internet exchange. It is a simple 
Ethernet LAN, with IP addresses 172.16.0.0/24 for its members. Like the AMS-IX, the 
OS3-IX has technical policies <a href="#Ref1">1</a>.  Members are not allowed to use 
the following protocols on the AMS-IX LAN: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Open Shortest 
Path First (OSPF) or Routing Information Protocol (RIP). 


<a name="Sec2"></a><h4>2 Building an Internet Exchange</h4> 

<P> Today we will work on coupling together our UML instances, which run inside the 
DomUs. We will be using the secondary bridge so that we are not bothered by traffic 
coming from the regular internet. Make sure it is running correctly. 


<P> <a name=2></a>Xen assigns random MAC addresses to your interfaces in a HVM. To 
ensure we do not have clashes on the network, figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a> lists 
your assigned MAC address range for your interfaces.  Once you have configured your 
HVM (re)start it and log in to it. Then enter the following commands on the DomU: 

<PRE>
 $ sudo chmod 666 /dev/net/tun 
 $ sudo brctl addbr br0 
 $ sudo brctl addif br0 eth1 
 $ sudo ip link set eth1 up 
 $ sudo ip link set br0 up 
 $ sudo tunctl -t tap0 -u &lt;your username&gt; 
 $ sudo brctl addif br0 tap0 
 $ sudo ip link set tap0 up 
</PRE>


<P> You can now boot your UML through your own preferred script and use the uml 
mconsole like so: 

<PRE>
 $ uml_mconsole BGPROUTER config ethx=tuntap,tap0 
</PRE>


<P> Once that is done, you can log in to the UML instance. You should now have an extra 
interface. To verify that it works, you can do the following: 

<PRE>
 $ ip address add 172.16.0.xx/24 dev ethx 
</PRE>

Start your UML network and check if you can ping a machine in the exchange LAN: 

<PRE>
 $ ping 172.16.0.8 
</PRE>


<a name="Sec3"></a><h4>3 Peering and Transit</h4> 

<UL>
  <LI> Now set up BGP on your router using your assigned AS-number. 
  <LI> Work together ith the other members at your table to set up peering. Use your 
       border routers to peer with one of your group members. Test if the connectivity 
       between the networks is as you expected, and document your findings. 
  <LI> In your group, enable transit one by one, until all networks can reach each 
       other.  Document the changes you made to the networks. What does the network in 
       your group look like, and what are the relations? 
  <LI> Now choose two members to set up peering with other tables that have also 
       finished setting up peering with each other. Write the peering setup on the 
       board so that the rest of the class knows who's peering with who. 
</UL>

<a name=3-1></a><h5>3.1 Bogon IP addresses</h5> 

<P> Bogon IP blocks <a href="#Ref2">2</a> are IP ranges that are announced in BGP, even 
though the range has not been assigned by IANA. How this can be used by spammers to 
avoid identification? 


<UL>
  <LI> Select a network to act as a 'rogue network', announcing bogus IP ranges. Can 
       the other networks filter these bogon announcements? How can the Bogon IP list 
       like <a href="http://www.completewhois.com/bogons/">bogons</a> (from 
       http://www.completewhois.com/) help you? Would you peer with AS 112? 
</UL>

<a name="Sec4"></a><h4>4 Bonus</h4> 

<UL>
  <LI> What happens if one network in your group adds a local preference? What if 
       everyone does this? 
  <LI> Create a second border router in your network, using a second tap interface. 
       Enable iBGP between your routers. Separate the two peering relations in your 
       group into two routers, with a connection in between, and experiment with 
       different settings on both routers. Can you do load balancing?
