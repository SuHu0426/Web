<p>If you've arrived at this blog post I'd have to assume you're 
familiar with what KVM is, but for the benefit of those who are unaware 
or are just interested in reading more, I'll give a bit of a background...
 Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a kernel module that was 
originally developed by an Israeli organisation called Qumranet to 
provide native virtualisation technology for Linux-based platforms; 
essentially turning the kernel into a Tier-1 hypervisor. It has since 
been ported to multiple other platforms and architectures other than 
32/64-bit x86. It got initially adopted into the upstream Linux kernel 
as of 2.6.20 (back in 2007).<span id="more-275"></span></p>

<p>Typically KVM is designed to run on-top of a bare-metal Linux machine
 with a CPU that supports virtualisation extensions, i.e. Intel VMX and 
AMD SVM. This allowed a physical machine to run multiple virtual 
machines on-top (using associated components such as libvirt and qemu), 
but there's a new neat technology known as 'nested KVM', in other words,
 KVM support within a KVM-based guest or a hypervisor within a guest. 
You may ask the question 'why do we need this?'... well, in my position 
I'm often running into situations where I have to carry out product 
demonstrations or debugging hypervisor environments, having another 
layer of virtualisation abstraction with nested-KVM is great, especially
 when on the train or on a plane!</p>

<p>There are, of course, some performance problems with doing this but 
for debugging or wanting to spin up a test environment with technologies
 such as Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation or VMware on a single machine
 it's quite a nice solution. So let's look at how to enable it first, by
 default it's usually disabled, at least on my Fedora 16 machine (you 
can replace Intel with AMD here if you have an AMD-based processor)...</p>

</PRE>

<p>To enable it, we need to make sure the KVM architecture specific module is loaded 
with the nested option. There are a few options for enabling it, the first way to do 
this is just update your boot loader to specify the nested option; that way it 
persists with a reboot or kernel upgrade. Assuming you're using Fedora with GRUB2, 
(as root) you need to update the '<em>/etc/default/grub</em>' file and append 
'<em>kvm-intel.nested=1</em>' to the <em>'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</em>' line. For 
reference, mine is specified below, remember to replace 'intel' with 'amd' if 
required.</p>

<PRE>
# cat /etc/default/grub | grep CMDLINE
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=vol0/swapVol
 rd.md=0 rd.dm=0&nbsp; KEYTABLE=us quiet rd.lvm.lv=vol0/rootVol rhgb 
rd.luks=0 SYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 LANG=en_US.UTF-8 kvm-intel.nested=1" 
</PRE>


<p>Once this is specified, you'll need to rebuild your GRUB configuration files so 
that when you next reboot the command line 
arguments you just specified are loaded, note the GRUB2 configuration 
location may be different on a non-Fedora machine...</p>

<PRE>
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 
</PRE>


<p>Alternatively, (thanks to Dominic Cleal for the suggestion) this can 
be modified using the modprobe configuration files, making things 
slightly easier-</p>

<PRE>
$ echo "options kvm-intel nested=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf 
</PRE>


<p>I would now recommend rebooting your machine to verify the changes 
have been made. Once again, you can re-run the previous command to check
 this and you should see that the changes to the module have been made.</p>

<PRE>
$ cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested 
Y 
</PRE>


<p>And that's it, you've successfully enabled nested-KVM. Next, when you
 create new virtual machines, e.g. with virt-manager, you will need to 
'require' vmx or svm to be presented to the virtual machine; that way 
the guests can make use of the underlying nested-KVM features that have 
been enabled. This can also be done via direct modification of the 
libvirt XML definition of a given virtual machine, an example of one of 
my VM's is shown below-</p>

<PRE>
 &lt;cpu match='exact'>
  &lt;model>Westmere&lt;/model>
  &lt;feature policy='require' name='vmx'/>
 &lt;/cpu>
</PRE>


<p>Any questions please feel free to get in touch, I'd be happy to help out. </p>

<p>Really good article Rhys, I'd never heard of a hypervisor with this feature 
until now. </p>

<p>At first it strikes you as a really peculiar option - you can see why it is disabled 
by default. Clearly, in the example you gave, such as debugging a hypervisor or similar, 
it would be really useful to run virtual.</p>

<p>Thanks Rhys.  Slightly easier than updating GRUB is just to use modprobe:</p>

<p>echo "options kvm-intel nested=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf</p>

<p>Looking in virt-manager, I see I didn't have the CPU model set up to 
be the same as the host's (there's a simple button under Processor that 
sets it up).  I wonder how performance would have been affected 
with/without the extra SSE3/4 type extensions that it's now enabled?</p>

<p>Great write up. WIll definitely be putting this to the test. </p>

<p>Keep it up</p>

<p>Thanks for the alternative method, Dom! </p>

<p>Sounds like you have some performance testing to do  </p>

<p>Thanks for the tip Rhys, looking forward to trying this one out for local test deployments etc.!</p>

<p>Thanks for the great guide.</p>

<p>I'm trying this in my ubuntu 12.02 but after run:<br>
' echo "options kvm-intel nested=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf '<br>
and reboot seems like nested don't be able yet.<br>
The ' cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested ' returns N (instead of Y).</p>

<p>Anyone can help me and point some direction?<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>@Rapha, this guide was written for 
Fedora/Red Hat based distributions. Ubuntu doesn't have a modprobe.d 
configuration directory. You'll need to make the necessary changes to 
the correct file, see <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/51226/how-to-add-kernel-module-parameters" rel="nofollow">http://askubuntu.com/questions/51226/how-to-add-kernel-module-parameters</a> for details.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, this is all done on the bare-metal host, right?</p>

<p>I've been trying to get KVM guests to work on a rented KVM host, but 
that host in itself is of course a KVM guest on the company's bare-metal
 server.</p>

<p>So from this post, I understand that it is they who have to enable 
nested KVM, to expose it to me (for the befenfit of the guests I want to
 run).</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
